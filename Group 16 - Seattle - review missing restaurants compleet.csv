Today's experience was the icing on the cake where they denied us service at 10.05pm for a 10pm reservation because their ""kitchen was closed"". I cant understand how a restaurant would accept a 10pm reservation but deny entry 5 mins later. And this is when they were accepting reservations till 10.15pm. Thanks for a great friday night - I will never come back again."

Kedai Makan,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kedai-makan-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Nina G.,2.0,3/9/2024,9,NY,"While the lack of takeout was infuriating at the old Kedai, I have gotta say the new one skimps on portion sizes and the out-of-this-galaxy flavor. You literally bought the recipes from the owners, why not stick to them? Take the flavors and portions they pushed out and add takeout - you will see a healthy profit AND a loyal fan base. For now, I'm holding off on this place again until they find the essence of their food, again."
Kedai Makan,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kedai-makan-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Kelly B.,2.0,9/29/2015,49,WA,"What was wrong with the old menu that we all knew and loved? Add drinks and seating, then it would have been perfect. But the new menu is nothing special, unfortunately."
Kedai Makan,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kedai-makan-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Sienna K.,3.0,2/27/2024,3,WA,"What we took away - I wasn't impressed. None of the dishes stood out. Kerabu Mangga - the mix of ripe and semi ripe mangoes in the salad didn't work, i was so excited to order it. The fried rice was too salty to taste on its own. It came with a sweet chilli sauce which was helpful. The pork ribs were good, but they were dry. I had heard good things about this place but maybe we caught them on a bad day."
Kedai Makan,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kedai-makan-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Kaylyn T.,3.0,2/3/2023,1,WA,"The original Kedai Makan was one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle, but the new version is a bit of a disappointment. The new location has its pros (much bigger, almost no wait times, nice ambience) but seems to be missing what the original was known for--fantastic food. While the menu is similar, the quality of the food has gone downhill at the new location and the prices have gone up. The texture of the roti net bread was off, the dhal was super oily and missing the depth of flavor it once had, and the nasi goreng could best be described as ""okay"". The new location might be worth trying for an introduction to Malaysian food, but if you've visited the old, I'm not sure it'll live up to expectations. I was really looking forward to seeing this place come back to life, but I will not be returning."

I really wanted to try this place before they close. Overall, the food was good but just not sure it was worth the hype. I waited in line since 10:30am to put my name down and got a table for 5pm. Their jala was delicious but other vegetarian options were ok. The pudding with longan berries was great!"
Kedai Makan,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kedai-makan-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Edwiny D.,3.0,5/4/2021,5,WA,"They had a variety of dishes but I believe they could cook better. I guess they have to serve a crowd so they do it fast and some out of it remains uncooked. And some part of it was a little burnt assuming it got overcooked a little. They are good on the quantity , have to match up on the quality."
Kedai Makan,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kedai-makan-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Ajay C.,3.0,9/3/2019,395,WA,"A recipe has no soul. The cook must bring soul to recipe. I would say this place partially succeeded in doing the job. I think it's a 3.5*, here is why -Ordered -Kerabu Timun Nanas : cold salad heavily loaded with peanuts and some curry powder I guess. Pineapple and cucumber are my favorite things on this world and this salad ruined it for me.Cocolife : rum, coconut cream and curry powder? Looks interesting right? Tasted like 2/5. Highly not recommended.Roti Jala: sounds like an Indian origin. Best of all the dishes I ordered. If you have tried rice crepes before, roti just tastes like that. Side of dal tasted delicious though.Malay fried peanuts: flavored peanuts that are crispy and tasty.Wait times are crazy, waited close to 1.5hrs. You see more than 4.5*, but honestly I'm not impressed."

They could be more honest about it. In California restaurants will give you a complimentary drink or something. Last time here. There are plenty of good places in Seattle.

Tikka masala chicken katsu was an interesting fusion dish. It was good but not something I feel like i need to get again. I think I like the loco moco with scotch egg more. Seems like their menu rotates though since I didn't see some of the items I saw on yelp on their menu. Food was definitely on the pricier side but maybe thats expected from this being more of a bar? 3.5/5

For a party of two, we definitely ordered more with our eyes, but everything just sounded so good that it was hard not to! We had the oysters, Seattle dog musubi, and loco moco scotch egg. The loco moco scotch egg was actually so filling that I had a good amount of leftovers. Looking forward to returning soon since service was friendly and attentive, and the food was tasty. I still need to try the oxtail risotto and tikka tonkatsu don!Highly recommend making reservations in advance, as the restaurant tends to get full pretty often."

Finding truly authentic Malay food in America can be a challenge, so our expectations were high.Roti Jala: This dish surprised me because I had never tried net bread before. I found the chewy texture to be delightful, and it ended up being my favorite from the meal.Nasi Lemak: The dish was good, and the flavors were quite authentic. However, the sambal didn't quite hit the mark.Rusuk Babi: The ribs were fantastic, tender, but the dish overall was very spicy!In summary, the food was good and reasonably authentic.

While there were some remarkable highlights, a few minor areas held back what could have been a perfect dining experience.First and foremost, the Nasi Lemak was a delightful choice, and opting for the tofu option turned out to be a great decision. The dish was flavorful and authentically prepared, showcasing the kitchen's skill in crafting this Malaysian classic.The Roti Jala with chicken curry was not only very good but also visually appealing. The intricate lace-like pattern of the Roti Jala added an extra layer of charm to the dish, and the accompanying chicken curry was rich and savory.However, the real star of the meal was the Chili Pan Mee. It stood out as the best among the dishes we tried. The flavors were explosive, and the noodles were cooked to perfection, maintaining just the right level of consistency. It's a must-try for those seeking a flavorful punch in their meal.On a positive note, the restaurant honored our check-in and offered us a delightful treat to end our meal: coconut ice cream. It was a pleasant surprise and a perfect conclusion to the dining experience."

I recently tried out the No Wait app to ""get in line"" rather than actually get in line. The only problem is that you can't get in line until the restaurant opens. I used the app 30min after the restaurant opened on a Tuesday evening and still had to wait almost 2 hours to be seated. Plan on getting pre-dinner drinks at the bars around the corner if you decide to come here. The food is always amazing and makes you feel like the wait was worth it. The menu seems to be slightly different every time I visit so I am always trying something new. I recently had some very spicy and crispy chicken wings. the Jala bread was very delicate and almost melted in my mouth with the curry (?) dipping sauce. For my entree, I enjoyed the nashi goering (?). The food is always hot, always delicious, and heats up well the next day for more goodness. While the food is great, service is sub par. Waitors seems to enjoy plenty of relaxed conversations with each other at the bar while my throat is burning since I seem to never have my water refilled...Would very much appreciate a bit more attentive service. The restaurant is always packed and hiring an extra bus boy/water boy would make a huge difference in service."

Last night I had the pleasure of dining here and their food did not disappoint. Soul food classics get a delicious upgrade with fresh local seafood and ingredients. I devoured my seafood boil with a side of greens and can't wait to go back to try some new dishes (they update their menu according to what's fresh in season). I absolutely love the ambiance too.

The bonus meal you get from leftovers are icing on an already delectable cake of carbs, carbs, and more delicious carbs.If you're looking for something extra special (in a unique way, not a you'll-necessarily-like-it way), try the Chinese herb-infused shots.

Adding 20% to the bill WTF??? Oh no, Not giving this to the servers, but pocketing for pure profit. Unscrupulous to wait to the end of the meal to tell us. What's the issue?

He was very rude and stereotyped us right from the start! Told us they weren't taking walk-ins and while we were literally standing right there he offered 4 other people walk-in spots!  He also turned the Asian guy away!  How can he be LBGTQ and still judge people? He should know better about being judged.  Such a shame! If zero stars were an option I would have gladly entered it.

There's no sign about this charge and you'll find out on the receipt when you are paying. You end up paying over 40% to the total when you include gratuity for your server. I'm NOT going back to this restaurant!
Elliott's Oyster House,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/elliotts-oyster-house-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Donna V.,1.0,6/6/2018,1,WA,"While I was dining at Elliot's Oyster House, I witnessed the most appalling scene. Near my table, a man was being interviewed for a serving job. The hiring manager, at a certain point, said to the applicant, ""Look around at the servers. We don't hire your kind here."" The applicant was a black man. The applicant had a friend (maybe partner? unsure) with him who immediately got up to leave. The applicant replied to the hiring manager by saying, ""You can't talk to me like that, sir. That is out of line."" The hiring manager replied with, ""You know what? We don't even like serving your kind here,"" and promptly kicked the applicant and his companion out of the restaurant. I quickly asked for the check and left the restaurant. I don't care how good the food is or isn't, I vow to never support this restaurant again. If I had ever known that they employ racists and ask those racists to hire based on skin color, I never would have set foot in the establishment in the first place. The sheer audacity that a hiring manager felt comfortable having this conversation in the dining area, within earshot of paying customers, is indicative of the kind of insidious racism that can't be pinned on one solitary employee. Elliot's can't do anything to make up for this. I can't imagine what the culture is like in the kitchen, where the line staff is likely entirely composed of people of color. Will never set foot in here again and highly encourage everyone to reconsider spending their money in a place that discriminates against the African American community."

The restaurant is located in a very touristy location, which takes away from the experience. Oysters: The oysters all tasted the same and were not particularly memorable. There are better places for oysters in Seattle. Appetizers: The calamari is frozen, not fresh, which the waitress was forthcoming about when we asked. We did not order it. The crab cakes were fine, but not remarkable. I ordered the Cioppino for the main course. The fish was tough--I did not like the texture and was not sure how fresh the fish was. Bottom line: Save your money for better food and a better atmosphere in a less touristy part of town."

The oysters were fantastic, especially with the awesome toppings they came with. The mussels were great, and the crab cakes were delish. The salmon Caesar was also very tasty.The views from the patio are lovely, which definitely added to our experience. The service, on the other hand, was just okay. It started off pretty slow, and unfortunately, our server forgot to bring the spicy crab & corn chowder we were excited to try. But overall, we still had a good experience!"

Elliott's Oyster House,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/elliotts-oyster-house-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=10,Paul K.,3.0,5/27/2023,47,FL,"We recently dined at Elliott's Oyster House during our Seattle visit and our experience was a mixed bag. Let's start with the beverages - I ordered an Old Fashioned and Amy had a glass of cider. The Old Fashioned was quite disappointing. Note to all restaurants - don't serve this classic cocktail without a single ice cube, it's a major faux pas.We kicked off our meal with an assortment of oysters. It's fascinating how different oysters can taste depending on their origin, and as someone who prefers ones that carry the taste of the sea, this was a treat. The Ahi Tuna Tacos were next - they were perfectly portioned and tasted incredibly fresh.The Seafood Pasta was a hearty and rich dish, with shellfish taking center stage. However, my wife Amy wished there had been more shrimp. The seasonal specialty, a Halibut dish, came served with fresh vegetables and was full of flavor.But here's where things get tricky - Elliott's Oyster House is not easy on the wallet. The prices are quite steep, and to add to that, there's a mandatory 20% service charge added to the bill. The check mentions that part of this charge is shared with the service staff, who are paid a competitive wage. But what's unclear is the exact portion of the service charge that actually goes to the staff. In comparison, other similar establishments often explicitly outline what percentage of the service charge goes to the wait staff. Without this knowledge, customers like us are left wondering if we should tip more and whether the servers are actually benefitting from the service charge. In conclusion, while the food at Elliott's Oyster House is truly wonderful, the service charge practices leave you with an unsavory aftertaste. It's a real pity, as such issues detract from an otherwise great dining experience."

We ordered the clam linguini, the seafood risotto, a couple of the fish a chips, a glass of wine and strawberry lemonade. We all felt the food was very tasty, packed with quality and fresh seafood. A good wine selection allowed for a good glass of wine and the strawberry lemonade was a hit with the kiddo in our party. But for the location, the up an coming newly revamped Seattle water front, this place fell short in terms of style and even cleanliness. The carpet throughout the place is truly done after way too many years of service, and the bathrooms were truly way out of sync with the location, menu prices and reputation of the place. So they loose a star (should have been minus 2 stars but wanted to be more lenient). The bathrooms were for sure fairly dirty, but the food still made up for the decaying ambiance. Hopefully it gets a lift sometime soon. P.S. the staff was welcoming, very nice and efficient.Thanks"

Best part of the whole thing. Better seafood experiences can be found other places with less tourists. But as far as an oyster bar it is perfection.

Smaller than I thought but oh so tasty!! We were a group of 28 so it was a tough order to keep us sorted out and the noise level was a challenge. All in all, the views, location, service and food were as I expected, pricy, above average quality and good service. I would go again for another special occasion. Requesting a quiet corner."

Eating them & then finishing it up with the dessert like Chinook salmon aka King Salmon alder planked prepared medium rare with beurre blanc & the season's fresh vegetables was surely a dessert of its own, as it is seldom noticed as one, whilst finishing sweet down my gullet with Omega 3 oily fats in the finest way possible. If I could see the merry catch hauled off the Puget Sound whilst eating the very catch, bait & shelled crustaceans as they're coming off the boat from the Pacific Ocean, then it would have surely been a more superlative sight to behold, & I may have added another star, so catch that. ;-) Being one of the tourist venues notwithstanding garners it one less star. Just eat, chat with the knowledgeable shuckers & then shlurppp some more, & then what? Then proceed outward bound hastily walking out from Elliott's, which is packed like sardines with the general ill-informed tourist populace popping their heads in here thinking this is THE place where locals go, & then constantly bobbing their heads in disbelief like the buoys you can also see out in the water. :-PGood, attentive service followed by the charging of my phone was even better than the real catch. ;-)"

They had an amazing spread of oysters and delicious food. We split the strawberry and walnut salad and the ciopino. Only reason why not 5 stars is although the food was good, the price was very high. Bread and butter was an extra $5 which seems ridiculous not to include that at a fine dining restaurant when you're asking patrons to pay $35+ per plate not including apps, drinks, etc."

Service the first night, brilliant, I 'd crab and they did the total crab service with the bib, hand washing and all that fun stuff. The second time we had a younger waiter that 'spoke too much"" according my honey. I adored the salmon bisque and the crab (yeah, not overly original). Honey had oysters galore and they were fresh (made me have a flashback to my days as a mermaid) but I actually can not tell the distinct in flavor."

A race to order more before prices hike up every 30 minutes. They seem to have a good selection of local draft beers as well which go well with the oysters!

Those slimy gooey sexy little briny bivalves! OMG. I think the oysters here were definitely the highlight of our self-guided Seattle food and drink tour. Pretty cool little happy hour deal on them too - I think they start at like 75 cents each and then increase every half hour. Unfortunately, we got there at the last half hour, so by that time they were $1.75 each, but damn, they were worth it. And the oyster shucker (oyster tender?) knew a LOT about all of them, giving us samples of his favorites as we dined at the bar. It's a swanky spot for sure, perhaps a bit outside of our swank range, but we sat at the bar with a drink and some happy hour oysters (and other appetizers which were less memorable, including the babiest sized mussels I have ever seen! - slightly disappointing) and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. So I say to you, Yelpers, go there for happy hour. Get there early and fill yourselves with many, many deliciously glistening oysters. They're good for you!"

Elliott's Oyster House,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/elliotts-oyster-house-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=80,Petey O.,4.0,5/13/2011,9,CA,"First stop in must do things in Seattle was the .50 cent oyster HH that runs Monday thru Friday. The way it works is starting at 3pm the HH prices are .50 cents each with a 3 dozen per table limit on the order. If you finish the ones you order you can order more but depending on the currnet time each half hour the price increases by .25 cents. Factors like the time to place the order and have the oysters shucked plus eat time can slow the glutany process down. At 4 when we finally made it there and got a table the price was already $1 per oyster, not terrible but not quite the price we had been shooting for so curse you broken GPS, Seattle freeway system, Seattle parking machines and man who took extra 20 mins at the table which we were waiting for at the bar......Yeah I know better planning should have been happening here but we were dying to try em. We also got $3 beers, oyster shooters and a few other appetizers for $3 each. The Salmon Slider was really awesome in my opinion but the fish taco was just ok. I liked the oyster but I didn't love them and I felt the sizes were not consistent but over all I would love to just stuff myself on .50 cent oysters next visit."

After wandering up and down the pier looking for a restaurant that my friend wanted to go to that he couldn't remember the name of, or where it was, or what it looked like, we settled on Elliot's.The food was great, and the waitstaff was very attentive. We started with the Appetizer Tower, which the waiter seemed a little shocked that we wanted that much food between the two of us for our APPETIZER, but neither of us had eaten anything all day, and hell, we were in for an adventure. I didn't try any of the calamari, but my friend said that it was very good, and I really enjoyed the crab cakes, and the dip was good as well. Ate my appetizers with a very tasty Lemon Drop.For entrees, I had the King Salmon and chips, he had the Blackened Rockfish. I'd never had breaded salmon before, and while it was good, it left a little to be desired taste-wise. The Rock Fish I was told was tasty, but could've tasted a little Blacker. Had my entree with the best Mai Tai I've ever had!For dessert, I had the Granny Smith Apple Napoleon, which was AMAZING, despite not a hazelnut to be seen. My friend had the Deep Fried Truffle Sundae, which I had a bite of and thought was very good.Finished the meal with some Kenyan coffee to sober us up enough to make it to our next destination :)All and all, it was a very good dining experience. They do get docked a star though do to our complaints (listed above) about the entrees, and the fact that while there was not another person out of the bar/lounge area, they still tried to hide us (a very pierced, tattooed, brightly colored duo) in the furthest table in the back."

The definition of a hole-in-the-wall. I got the regular hamburger and wow... there are no words. A classic burger done right. Crisp bun, juicy patty, stuffed with all the essentials (ketchup, shredded lettuce, tomato, and pickles).

And I wasn't disappointed. We sat at the Bar and was served delicious drinks by Ben. He also recommended some great pairing with our appetizers. He provided excellent service as we feasted on our Happy Hour oysters. They were delicious and too tempting when asked if we wanted more and the minutes seem to pass by faster. The ambiance is really great. You have the view right out to the pier. The food is on point. And I couldn't have been happier with my sweet fresh Seattle oysters. Shout out to Ben and the staff here!

They came with pink Himalayan salt as well as tobasco sauce, and a house made sauce. You can't complain about the cost, and you don't feel guilty eating so many!The service was very friendly, we ordered more as we went and also asked for more sauce and our waiter happily helped us.

They don't give any attitude and will take good care of you. I never thought that I would be able to differentiate between various types of oysters before I started coming here but I was pleasantly surprised. There are a lot of tourists that stop in but it's one of the best attractions in Seattle. It can get a little busy so you need to know when to go, otherwise the service is quick and enjoyable. Its' also clean considering how many people stop in every day. If you are looking for the freshest oysters, go there and you will not be disappointed."

The wait staff was very courteous and attentive, and their recommendations on the menu were very helpful. We had the smoked salmon linguine and Rockfish tacos, along with an oyster sampler. The champagne topping for the oyster sampler went well with the oysters, without overpowering them. The salmon linguine was delicious and a generous portion size, due to being so rich! I actually had trouble finishing it. The Rockfish tacos were delicious and had a very fun presentation - the redness of the very large cut of Rockfish was an eye-catcher. The texture was perfect - most and just flakey enough. The atmosphere and food were top notch, and the setting can't be beat. I would take any newcomer to Seattle here for a real experience of Seattle living!"

I was there today with my girlfriend, and we ordered the same food, but the taste was different. I'm not sure why but it does not taste the same anymore. Very disappointed. Of course, people who never tried this food before will be good to them, but those who have been already eaten this food before will see the difference right away. I hope you guys will bring back the same authentic taste as it was before."
Skalka,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/skalka-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,David Q.,5.0,7/22/2021,5,CA,Waited 50 minutes. Was told to deal with it.It's a pizza (with egg) place. Totally not worth it.
Skalka,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/skalka-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Timofei K.,1.0,9/5/2021,29,WA,"Ridiculous wait list management. We have been said it would take 30 minutes wait, and it haven't been ended in more than an hour."
Skalka,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/skalka-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Bryanna R.,1.0,2/21/2021,7,GA,"I recently visited shalka and found their concept to be quite unique. The food itself was absolutely delicious, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, I do have a few concerns regarding the service that I would like to address, which is why I am deducting a few stars from my overall rating.One issue I encountered was the opening time. Despite the advertised opening time of 9AM, the door was already open for guests to enter before that. It was a bit confusing as we were told that they don't officially open until 9AM, even though we were allowed to hang out inside until then. This inconsistency in their opening procedure was a little frustrating.Additionally, there was a situation where someone placed an order at 8:48AM, and they were told that they needed to wait until 9AM. This kind of miscommunication or refusal of service after the official opening time can be quite off-putting for customers.Lastly, when we wanted to share our meals, we realized that there were no knives available. It would have been more convenient if the restaurant had provided all the necessary utensils to enjoy the meal properly.In order to enhance the overall experience, I would suggest that shalka ensures that their doors are not opened before the official opening time if they are not ready to serve customers yet. Consistency in adhering to the advertised opening hours would greatly improve the customer experience. Additionally, it would be beneficial for them to ensure that all necessary utensils are readily available for customers, especially if sharing meals is encouraged."
Skalka,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/skalka-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Veronica L.,3.0,5/27/2023,67,WA,"This place does bread bowls right! The filling is delicious--cheesy, flavorful, and super satisfying. They offer options for everyone, with chicken, beef, or vegan choices, so there's something for every preference. Each bread bowl is made to order, keeping it nice and crispy on the outside while perfectly holding all that tasty goodness inside. The place itself is clean and set up for self-service, from ordering to cleanup, which makes it an easy, casual stop. Definitely worth a visit if you're craving a hearty, well-made bread bowl!"
Skalka,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/skalka-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Abhijit S.,4.0,11/1/2024,88,WA,"Despite frequently passing by this restaurant, it was my first visit, inspired by rave reviews. I decided to go for brunch on a Saturday, but the timing coincided with the Seafair Torchlight Parade, which led to most streets being closed. After 30 minutes of searching, I found street parking nearly a mile away and walked to the restaurant.**Ambiance**:The restaurant has large floor-to-ceiling windows that let in plenty of natural light, creating an airy and welcoming atmosphere. The decor is funky and fun, adding to the overall charm.**Ordering Process**:I ordered at a kiosk and provided my phone number, which felt unnecessary. It would be more customer-friendly to use numbered tokens instead of collecting personal information. After ordering, the food was brought to my table, and there were no further interactions with the staff during my meal.**Food**:I ordered a Lobiani, which consisted of red beans, runny eggs, bacon, banana peppers, and butter melting into the cheese alongside the egg yolk. Initially, I was unsure how to eat it, but I decided to chip away at the fresh and fluffy bread and use a fork for the filling. Once it was small enough, I used my hands. Although it didn't look very big, it was quite filling, and I had some leftovers.**Taste**:The food was good, but it didn't live up to the rave reviews that had set my expectations very high. It reminded me of a pizza, especially with the egg yolk and two handle-like protrusions on each side. However, it was still enjoyable and satisfying.**Value**:The price was around $18, which seemed reasonable for the portion and quality.**Conclusion**:I have nothing bad to say about the food, but it wasn't as mind-blowing as some reviews claimed. Despite that, I'm a sucker for breakfast restaurants and wouldn't hesitate to return."
Skalka,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/skalka-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Stephanie G.,4.0,7/27/2024,473,CA,"Nestled on the outskirts of Pikes Place in Seattle, Skalka offers a delightful culinary experience with a scenic backdrop that complements its unique approach to dining. The restaurant's commitment to delicious food and an innovative online ordering system makes it a standout in the bustling Seattle food scene.One of the notable features of Skalka is its picturesque location, providing a charming escape from the urban hustle. The ambiance is perfect for those seeking a break from the Pike's Place touristy noise.Skalka takes an unconventional approach to ordering, with the entire process conducted online. While this may be a novel concept, it does streamline the ordering process, ensuring efficiency and accuracy. However, this approach might not suit everyone, especially those who prefer a more traditional experience with face-to-face interaction.The menu at Skalka boasts a variety of delectable options, showcasing a fusion of flavors that cater to diverse palates. The Chicken Boat seemed a bit overwhelming and a bit to ummm mushy. In hindsight, opting for the Cheese Boat alone might have been a wiser choice, as it allowed the individual ingredients to shine without the slight overcrowding observed in the Chicken Boat.While the food at Skalka is undoubtedly a highlight, the service could use a friendlier touch. The online ordering system, while efficient, lacks the personal interaction that many patrons seek in a dining experience. A bit more warmth and engagement from the staff could elevate the overall satisfaction for guests. If the restaurant could enhance its service with a more personable touch, it would undoubtedly secure its place as a must-visit destination on the outskirts of Pikes Place in Seattle."

They make the food to order and it shows. The bread was crisp on the outside and pillowy on the inside. The toppings were fresh and perfectly cooked.

2120,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/2120-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Chenghao L.,1.0,12/17/2018,40,IL,Bad service. Bad server with impolite attitude. Very racist restaurant. Always ignore Asian faces and lie that they don't provide this or that even yelp shows other customers are taking the same service. Don't go. Try somewhere else.
2120,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/2120-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Steven L.,1.0,9/7/2018,7,WA,"I decided to check this place out while I was downtown checking out the biospheres. A weird latin influenced menu which doesn't seem to be figured out yet. The chef seems confused. The cocktails are ok, however there bartender seemed almost irritated that he had to serve me and wasn't very knowledgeable for the food. He was very rude. If your in the hospitality business, shouldn't you not serve with a smile. The location & design are the only reason its getting any star. Underwhelming indeed."

The cool and cozy atmosphere created a special mood for the evening. The service also deserves the highest praise - the staff was attentive and friendly. However, there is one point that slightly clouded my experience. After trying the Prime New York Steak, I ordered it Well Done. Unfortunately, the dish was brought medium rare. But it is worth nothing that when I brought this error to the attention of the waiter, the problem was promptly corrected.Thus, despite a small glitch with the order, the overall impression of the 2120 establishment remained positive."
2120,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/2120-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Marianna K.,3.0,2/12/2024,54,WA,"I visited the restaurant for a mid-week dinner. I had made a reservation a few weeks in advance and arrived slightly late due to traffic. Thankfully, they accommodated us, but requested that we finish by a specific time, which was fine as we had enough time. A nice touch was the free parking available in the same building after 4 pm.The restaurant was quite busy, and it took a while before someone noticed us and took our reservation. However, once we were attended to, the service was smooth. The closely spaced tables contributed to noticeable noise levels, but it wasn't unbearable.We started with some small dishes, which arrived quickly. However, our main courses took a bit longer. We ordered six items, but only one stood out for me, and I would consider ordering it again: the calamari. The green salad was good but rather simple, consisting of greens, strawberries, and crumbled cheese with a tasty vinaigrette. It was enjoyable but not quite at the level I expected.The calamari was very good, with the highlight being the yogurt sauce (though it was labeled as labneh, it wasn't as sour as traditional Mediterranean labneh). The warm spices added a nice touch.The pork belly roulette was disappointing and felt like a calorie waste.I had high hopes for the steak tartar, but it turned out to be overly sour, with the sourness overshadowing the gentle sweetness of the yolk. The textures of the meat and the popping mustard seeds were interesting, but the sourness was too much for my taste.My husband ordered the rack of lamb, which tasted very good but was rather small for its $62 price tag, consisting of only two chops and some veggies.The cream puff had a moderate sweetness level, which was appreciated. However, I found the cream both inside and outside to be overly fatty, with just a hint of fruit filling in the middle. I would have preferred a better balance with less cream and more filling.Despite the restaurant's great reviews, I don't plan on returning."
2120,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/2120-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Libby B.,4.0,6/24/2019,22,WA,I liked this place a lot! I came in for brunch and the food/ drink aesthetic was very pretty and the flavors were very well mixed too! It is also across the street from the Amazon spheres and that was neat. The one downside I really had was that my poached eggs were really over cooked and that's never fun. But I'd definitely be open to coming back!
2120,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/2120-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Christine P.,5.0,6/3/2024,28,WA,"A solid salad, enough to fill you up although I don't think they give as much as evergreens does. Here, I'd stick to a preset menu item over individually ordering because so many things cost extra that it's too much to keep track of. The harvest salad was definitely yummy but I really couldn't tell you how I ended up paying $20 for it. I feel like sweetgreen is cool because it's the prototype for these types of salad places but holy moly I don't want to pay this much for a bowl of kale."
2120,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/2120-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Steve M.,5.0,6/1/2024,353,CA,"I recently dined at 2120, an upscale casual restaurant located inside the Amazon One building, the birthplace of Jeff Bezos' empire. The ambience inside is warm and modern, with about thirty tables and a bar that seats around ten to fifteen people. The restaurant also boasts a very nice patio that overlooks a globe building, adding to its aesthetic appeal.The highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the food and the service. I started with the carrots as an appetizer, which had a surprising texture similar to a baked potato rather than traditional carrots. For the main course, I had the scallops, which were absolutely amazing--tender and delicious, served with a curry and cumin sauce that was out of this world and really highlighted the dish. We also tried the Belgian frites, which were crispy and flavorful, clearly benefitting from their double-frying process.Our server, Will, was excellent. He was attentive without being overbearing, allowing us to enjoy our meal at a comfortable pace. He had great wine recommendations and picked out an incredible dessert for us, carrot cake, which was a perfect end to a wonderful meal. Will truly enhanced our dining experience with his professionalism and expertise.Overall, I highly recommend 2120 for its outstanding food, inviting atmosphere, and exceptional service."

This place had me drooling, and questioning why I hadn't discovered it sooner. Brace yourself for an epic culinary adventure that will leave your belly satisfied!Let's talk about the braised lamb cacciatore, shall we? It was so good that I momentarily forgot my own name. The lamb was so tender, it practically serenaded me with a love ballad as I took my first bite. The tomato sauce was so rich, it had more flavor than a Shakespearean tragedy. I half-expected the chef to burst out of the kitchen and take a bow for this masterpiece. Seriously, they should consider selling tickets to this lamb extravaganza--it's that good!And oh, the pumpkin puff! It was like the dessert gods decided to throw a party in my mouth. The puff pastry was so light and fluffy; I swear it had levitation powers. The pumpkin filling was like a magic potion brewed by a mischievous wizard. One bite, and I was under its spell--complete with giggles, swoons, and a longing for more. Move over Cinderella, this pumpkin creation is the real star of the fairytale!The ambiance was the cherry on top of this feast. The lighting was dim enough to create an intimate atmosphere, but not so dim that I couldn't see my food (because let's be honest, that would be a tragedy).To sum it up, 2120 is the place where culinary excellence. The braised lamb cacciatore and pumpkin puff are the headliners of this comedy show for your taste buds. The staff deserves a standing ovation for their top-notch service. So, bring your appetite, and get ready to feast on delicious food at 2120. It's a culinary adventure you won't soon forget!"

Looking at it from that lens, 2120's salmon would melt apart if you were to simply blow on it like a candle. It was buttery smooth, fatty, with almost no need to chew. It was perfection and I am already planning a return when back in Seattle later this year. Amazing food aside, I also want to shoutout their private dining service. Our group of 20 was welcomed to our dining room with a signature cocktail, a three-course menu imprinted with our names, and friendly service that didn't miss a beat.Highly recommend as a must-visit dinner restaurant."

I had the roasted delicata bowl and my friend had the Caesar salad with shrimp. Both were very good and full of flavor, and the portion sizes were generous. We each had a glass of ros�, which was also nice (I like that their wine list is Washington focused). Our food came out in a timely fashion, and our server was very pleasant. The restaurant itself is very pretty with a nice view of the Amazon biospheres. I also like that they have convenient parking in the building.

They have a nice selection of sandwiches, which they had previously, but also added a new Salads & Bowls section that has some yummy sounding dishes. It looks like the bulk of the new dishes have vegetarian options too. I had the roasted delicata dish, and it was very good! Full of flavor, and quite filling. The food came out quickly too, which is great for my lunch time crunch. I look forward to trying some more of the new lunch dishes soon."

I've tried both the dinner and brunch menus, both of which I liked. The lunch menu was also quite good. I like the addition of their ""Bowls & Salads"" section, as it adds a nice, light option. Each of the dishes come with the option to add a protein (salmon, shrimp, or chicken), which is great, and I believe that they all come as vegetarian options by default (with out the added proteins, of course!). I had the quinoa bowl with shrimp, and it was very tasty, and filling, but not heavy. I like that I was able to get in an out for lunch at well under an hour too. I'll be back for sure."

The ambience is so cool.. right on the water and cool lighting. So much more sophisticated than Belltown, but with the mix of crowd (all different ages because it's in a hotel) it never seems pretentious. I've seen various music acts here most of which were fabulous... too good to be free! And the bartenders and wait staff are great (especially Lee at the bar).  The only reason I don't give 5 stars is that the drinks are on the spendy side, and they have to shut the music down at midnight."

They took care of customers and gave great service while keeping the drinks flowing for the dining room. Also, I need to give a shout-out to the guy cleaning up in the lodge area; he also did a great job.The food is top-notch, though-it's a bit on the high side, price-wise. A main course will be about $50-60. Expect to spend in the region of $150-200 dinner for two, including drinks. I had the clam chowder, and it was great. Seafood mix and steak were great, nice and done.The only downside would be that the place feels a little old, but that is not really a big deal."

The restaurant is located in a beautiful waterfront setting, offering stunning views of the Seattle skyline and Elliott Bay. The ambiance is sophisticated and elegant, making it a perfect choice for a special occasion or a romantic evening.The menu at Six Seven Restaurant features a variety of culinary delights. I had the opportunity to try their seafood dishes, and they were delicious. The flavors were well-balanced, and the presentation was impeccable. The freshness of the ingredients was evident in every bite, and the seafood was cooked to perfection.The service at Six Seven Restaurant was exceptional. The staff was attentive, and knowledgeable, and provided excellent recommendations. They were also mindful of dietary restrictions and accommodated special requests with ease.In addition to the wonderful food and service, the restaurant offers an extensive wine list and a well-crafted cocktail menu. The sommelier was helpful in suggesting pairings that enhanced the dining experience.The only minor drawback was that the prices at Six Seven Restaurant are on the higher side, reflecting the upscale dining experience and waterfront location. However, considering the quality of the food, service, and ambiance, it was a worthwhile investment.Overall, I would highly recommend Six Seven Restaurant to those looking for an elegant dining experience in Seattle. The combination of exquisite cuisine, impeccable service, and breathtaking views make it a standout restaurant that truly showcases the best of the city."

Having had dinner multiple times here before in their main dinning area, the food was more than impressive. The view is picturesque and the food is exceptional- for all intents and purposes, this was a great place for a wedding reception. While the overall picture was great, the Catering Team GAVE THEIR WEDDING CAKE AWAY.The cake was bought through Palisade made through a local vendor, Dessert Works, with whom they had a cake tasting months prior like most couples do. The assistant manager came up to the BRIDE during the pictures and said that 'WE' have a problem. They had lost the cake.The bride and groom were nothing but pleasant and accommodating (what else were they supposed to do?) and had their ceremony. During the reception, the assistant manager again spoke to the bride and said that after investigating the matter, they had concluded the cake was GIVEN TO THE ANOTHER WEDDING RECEPTION THE NIGHT BEFORE. He proceeded to describe that 'WE' had two options: a cake from QFC (he misspoke and meant Whole Foods- imagine the astonishment) or cupcakes from Cupcake Royale. The Bride and Groom chose cupcakes and did not elude to their company of the unfortunate mistake as most of the guests thought this was their choice for dessert. Although many people choose cupcakes for their reception, this was not the cake they chose. After more investigating, Dessert Works did their job and delivered what could only be imagined to be a wonderful cake that another wedding party got to enjoy (were they VIP?) because the bride and groom's name was on the cake box according to Dessert Works.Palisade compensated in various ways but you can not replicate the moment or pictures of your wedding day again."

THIS IS THE ONLY RESTARAUNT I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN KICKED OUT OF! Why? Simply because I asked an obviously overworked doorman why my car hadn't been brought out for us when many others behind us in line were being brought their car?! He accused me of ""touching him"" on the shoulder. I was with a company christmas party in 2008, and EVERYONE WAS APPAULED. Needless to say I will never return. ALSO! Take notice that the people most excited about the restaraunt ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE. They often seem overwhelmed with satisfaction of their own restaraunt, snobbish. If you go, see if you agree....Oh! AND DEFINATELY DON'T USE THE VALET!!! Much better optioin is SALTY'S restaraunt in West Seattle, especially for Sunday brunch. Unlike the Palisades, it's an open buffet of EVERYTHING...meat, seafood, omelette bar, NOT JUST PANCAKES!"

The food quality was very disappointing. I had the surf and turf and ordered my steak medium rare. It came after a long 45+ minute wait, only to cut into it and it was well done. I never send food back, but I did on this occasion because it was a 3:15pm dinner reservation and there is no excuse to overcook steaks when it's not super busy. After sending it back, I was brought a steak that they just threw on the grill for a couple minutes on high heat and they called it a day. It was absolutely rare in the middle and burnt outside. Worst cooked steak ever. I ate it cause it was $74 but the whole deal was terrible. They were out of the desert we wanted at 4:30pm. They said it was cause of the banquet that they had. Ok lol. This place just sucked these days. If you're gonna spend money like that. Go somewhere else for sure. The view is nice of course. But you could find a way better restaurant."

Hostess staff great and the meal went downhill from there. Appetizer felt like QFC sushi cheap. Steak was overdone we sent back and my wifes sat there for 15 minutes - they brought another 22 minutes later after she had finished very poor serving should have taken hers to stay warm. Then forgot shared salad. When I went to the bathroom I asked to talk to the manager and they point out a bald guy named Paul who said oh he was really sorry. He then offered to buy us a drink, which we were charged for. So as we were leaving we asked to see him again to tell him. I saw him in the hallway behind the bathroom and they said nope he is not here. He was laughing with his girlfriend or hitting on a cocktail waitress. Only reason it gets 2 is the view and the hostess. Awful service and good food but very overpriced."

The food was ok, but the service definitely needs improvement. After remarking to our waiter that we had a hair on the caesar salad, the manager then came over and gave a half-hearted apology and quite frankly just ruined the evening for me and the misses. I don't mean to be one of those vindictive type of yelp reviewers, but certainly this place could use a bit of improvement. On the plus side, the Palisades Ocean Tower was delicious and the cabarnet short rib was delicious."

Meanwhile, we watched other customers, who arrived after us, being served promptly. The servers took their orders, brought out appetizers, and attended to them, but no one bothered to check on us.What made it even more frustrating was that the staff clearly saw us waiting--they even glanced in our direction several times--but chose to ignore us completely. It felt disrespectful and left us wondering why we were being treated this way.After waiting and hoping for someone to acknowledge us, we finally gave up and left. It was humiliating and upsetting to experience such poor service, especially when we had been excited to try a new restaurant.This was the first time something like this had ever happened to us at a restaurant, and it will certainly be the last time we visit Tanoor. If this is how they treat customers, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."

We decided to go on a Friday to avoid the dinner rush. It wasn't very busy, but we ended up waiting for service for 30 minutes. Nobody offered us water and we noticed other people being served. Eventually, we just decided to leave and went to a place across the street. Nobody said anything to us as we left; they seemed more interested in their own conversations. We won't be recommending this place to anyone. Maybe the food is good, but the service, or lack thereof, was really bad. Even Stone Korean, which is much smaller, has better service than this place."

House made pita... wow! With a large variety of dips- we had the muhammara - peppers,walnuts, pomegranate syrup with a touch of spiciness- could have made a meal from that and the pita! The mixed plate for 2-3 easily served 5 people- freshly grilled veggies, 3 quality meats cooked just right, yellow ( saffron?) rice.  Great value for the quantity of food!    No alcoholic drinks, but a wide variety of juices, teas, and Turkish coffee. Will definitely become a repeat customer!Dietary restrictions: Good variety of keto and vegetarian options.Wheelchair accessibility: I have limited mobility, so I appreciated the no barrier entry- they let me come in a different door,closer to where I parked. Parking nearby would be difficult, as one side of the building is on a steep hill."

I assume you're paying for the location rather than the food. Typical for a fame hungry business; ramp the price up for the location while serving unimpressive food. I could make the same meal for $25. I'm willing to pay for service buy you're being ridiculous.

I've worked in restaurants for years and know what good service is. after we were sat the waiter promptly took our drink orders before we could even take a look at the menu. interesting fact, the steaks here a way overpriced. i order the filet, and obviously at these prices i was expecting perfection. instead i got inspection, the steak appeared to be raw so i kindly notified the waiter that i would appreciate a few more min on the grill. when they brought it back to me 10 min later, it was medium well, i ordered medium rare. not to mention the sear on the steak was pathetic. I've been cooking all my life and I could have done better with a filet purchased from Wal-Mart! i was too upset to complain about my meal so i just bit the bullet of a steak and tried to enjoy the remainder of the evening. the service was good but i felt a bit of animosity from the waiter. not sure if ill be coming back here, It' s hard to recommend. el gaucho on the other hand...that's a different story.Ian W."

Two times with groups of about 10 and once with a date. The group things seem to put the staff in a bad way. One time we had extra drinks on our bill (The drinks we ordered from the bar due to not wanting to keep waiting forever for our waiter to take our order were paid for at the bar AND put on our receipt) including a bottle of wine we didn't order, a pile of plates were dropped, we literally did not get asked what choice of side we wanted until one of the people in our party asked the waiter if they wanted to know what we wanted, my steak (medium well) also was literally charred on both sides that the meat on the inside was only about 1/4 inch thick. I get that bigger groups are more difficult and things like dropping plates is just something that is going to happen but if you can't provide excellent service at this price point you need to stay within your abilities. My date experience was better but there's plenty of nice places at this price point that can really ""Wow"" you."

We visited for a New Year's Eve dinner and everything was going well--until just before midnight. Two minutes before the countdown, we received our dessert and asked if we could step outside to watch the fireworks. The staff asked us to leave our card as a precaution due to previous walkouts, which we did. However, when the fireworks ended, we found the doors locked and struggled to get back inside. To make matters worse, the waitress had already packed up our desserts and removed my glass of wine. This was not how I wanted to start the new year! The manager eventually offered to have our desserts remade at the table, but by that point, the damage was done. The experience left us all with a bitter taste.

My companion opted for the classic turkey, while I leaned towards the prime rib. The gustatory experience was undeniably praiseworthy, with flavors that underscored a notable culinary finesse.Service, operating within the parameters of adequacy, maintained an understated demeanor, providing a seamless backdrop to our dining experience.However, the post-dinner endeavor to secure leftovers took an unforeseen turn. A meticulous separation of meat and fat, coupled with a modest request for an extra serving of potatoes, aimed to prolong the culinary pleasure. Regrettably, upon revisiting the remains, the gastronomic continuity suffered a setback. The boxed ensemble, lacking cranberry sauce, horseradish that had been left on my plate, and the absent side of coveted potatoes I requested, presented a major Thanksgiving leftovers letdown---especially taking into consideration the high price we had paid for the meal. Nevertheless, let this culinary service anomaly not overshadow the overall commendable nature of the experience. As we contemplate future visits, a pragmatic approach emerges - a proactive request during the boxing process to ensure a more faithful representation of the intended leftovers. Here's to culinary precision and anticipating an untarnished encore in subsequent engagements."

The setting is beautiful with an amazing view! I would love to see what this place looks like during lunch or brunch hours. The food is phenomenal. We had prawns and artichokes as appetizers that were quite tasty. I ordered Salmon that had a tad bit of gumbo. It was delicious. My colleagues had the steak which looked great. Service was also great. Our waitress was extremely nice and made sure our food arrived in a timely manner. This is a wonderful restaurant.

I used Banner Banks smartphone app (official Banner Bank App promoted by bank) to make a deposit as I was leaving for vacation. I had used this process a couple of times before with no problem. This was used to move money from one of my bank account to another (available funds was never stated as a problem). The app involves submitting a photo of both the front and back of the check. When submitting the deposit the app show ""submitted"" as status. After reviewing, the app status gets changed to ""accepted"". I verified that the status was ""Accepted"" before leaving data coverage. When I returned on 7/19/2014, the status still showed ""accepted"" but the transaction was never processed. This resulted in overdraft fees of $120 plus the fees applied by the other banks that were declined. On 7/21/2014 I went to the branch to see what had happened. They said that they had questions about the check and had declined to process it. The teller told me that she didn't care what the app said, it didn't process and they weren't going to back off any charges. When I asked to speak to the manager I was asked to be seated. then a couple of minutes later the teller came back out and said that the manager ""reviewed the case"" and that they wouldn't make any changes. When asked if I could talk to her, I was told NO. When I returned home, I contacted the corporate office and was told it was up to the local branch manager. I did get a phone number for a regional supervisor (Marcello (425) 739-1055), but he seams to not want to answer his phone."

The food itself was just okay; while the Classic Smoked Salmon had a decent flavor, it didn't quite stand out as exceptional. The BBQ Pork was similarly average.

I really like the savory ones like the potato beef and the beef and cheese. There is usually a like but I enjoy it as a place to chat with some new people. Very reasonable prices and you can always tell they are fresh because they are making them right in front of you. I find myself next door at La Pania more often because I love to sit in front of the window and people watch with a cup of coffee and a piroshky.

The line was long, but it moved very quickly and even if it hadn't we still wouldn't have minded. The piroshky are DELICIOUS.

The line was very long! Its kind of a hole in the wall and its hard to get in, pay and get out without colliding with other people. The Piroshky was good.

This small, bustling bakery offers an incredible selection of hand-held pastries that are as delicious as they are iconic.I tried the Smoked Salmon Pate Piroshky, and it was everything I hoped for and more. The pastry itself was flaky, golden, and baked to perfection, while the filling was rich, flavorful, and packed with high-quality smoked salmon. The balance of buttery dough and savory filling made every bite unforgettable.Be prepared for a line--it's a testament to how beloved this spot is. But trust me, the wait is worth it. The staff works quickly and efficiently, and the pastries are always fresh out of the oven.Whether you're grabbing a quick bite while exploring Pike Place or looking for a unique Seattle treat to take home, Piroshky Piroshky delivers an authentic and satisfying experience."

They almost always have a line down the block. Just like Starbucks.  Do not fear the wait times though for Piroshky!!! The lines go very quickly and all food is made from scratch and very fresh!!!4/5 s for atmosphere because it is neat they have windows where you can see into the kitchen and watch them make everything and bake , but they do not have tables or chairs available!!We tried a savory and sweet piroshky! The savory was the salmon pate, which I felt was very fitting since we were visiting the fish market . It was smoked salmon and very creamy--absolutely delicious. The sweet was the Moscow roll. Another delicious choice 4/5 s for service. It is counter service and very quick paced. Not much time for friendly conversation, definitely not rude or bad, just too quick for much.A must try when you are visiting Pike Place Market and I rate it as a must try when in Seattle Peep the food pics there are yummy sights to see!"

Worth one visit, or if you have a favorite pastry here then it's worth a stop if you're in the area, but that's kind of it. I don't understand the super long lines and I definitely wouldn't stand in the cold for it. Sounds harsh, but this place gets so much hype and yes it's good, but the hype doesn't match the product in my opinion. Again, worth one visit, but not my favorite.My only favorite thing to get here is the pastry with the spicy cheese sausage in it. If anything, it speaks volumes on how good the sausage is, not the actual breading around it. It's the only thing I will buy here moving forward. Otherwise, workers here are very friendly and patient, they provide a very comfortable vibe and they are just so nice."

These piroshkies are a little different then what you would find in a typical Russian or Eastern European bakery. The dough is puff pastry instead of baked/fried bread. Reminds me of a fancy empanada or handpie. I had the beef and onion. Based on appearances, I was expecting it to sit like a brick in my stomach but the pastry was surprisingly light with a good beef flavor and nicely seasoned not overly salty. Wish I had more time and the stomach space to sample their other offerings."

This was actually my friends and I's FIRST stop in Seattle. We were hungry and we looked at my Seattle ""to do"" list and bam, there it was. Right in front of our eyes. We waited in the line outside with our luggage because we came straight from the airport. The line did go pretty quickly. Do you know what a piroshky is? If not, compare it to a pierogi or a kolachi. Basically bread with stuff .. stuffed inside lol. Carb heaven I must say. Everything has bread with it. Therefore, if you cannot eat carbs or it's a weakness for you, stay away lol. I ended up getting the Smoked Salmon Pate. Giving the traditional Piroshky a local spin, this bestseller is a delicious blend of Smoked Salmon, cream cheese, a dash of dill and onion. I really loved it. It was nice and warm and the smoked salmon was flavorful.Then during a food tour, I had the Smoked Salmon Pate and then an Apple Cinnamon Roll. This includes slices of Granny Smith Apples dusted with Cinnamon, rolled into dough and finished with a glaze of honey and lemon. It is their bestselling sweet creation. It was really good.The morning we had to run to the airport, we ended up coming back. I had the Spinach, Egg, and Cheese. It contained Spinach tossed with Parmesan then baked with egg. This squared pied is topped of a sprinkle of Columbia Valley Sharp Cheddar. Overall, it was a great experience. A little of the expensive side for a pastry. However, it's a ""must go"" for Seattle!

So I suggest you allow some time to drop by and pick up some items for dinner..we have never been disappointed on the items and fillings we have chosen, great flavored!

They're all pretty good, but my go-to is the beef and cheese. A close runner up is the potato and onion. The sweet ones are really good too. The bread is so flaky and warm. If you're ever in Pike Place Market, I would definitely recommend you check them out. The line can get long, but it's worth it. Best to go during the week."

I got a piroshky for the first time and it was delicious. I got the turkey and cheddar one and I would definitely recommend. It's always fun to try some food from different countries when you are just in downtown Seattle!
Piroshky Piroshky,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/piroshky-piroshky-seattle?not_recommended_start=180,Nicholas T.,4.0,6/1/2016,5,WA,I once dated a Russian / Armenian girl whos grandmother introduced me to the Piroshky (what a fun word by the way!)So after finding other spots through yelp I decided to give this one a go and look this place up... pretty glad that I did. Was not dissapointed one bit. I had never though salmon would go well in a piroshky but oh boy was I impressed. I want to go back and try them all. All the food is made fresh daily and it showsYou can taste the freshness in all of the food. I would consider this comfort food and again not sure if it is really healthy although my ex's g-ma used to say it was... Or maybe she wanted me to put those extra pounds on haha

They offer both sweet and savory options, but I tried savory options both times. Their signature item is a smoked salmon pate piroshky... I had someone explain it to me as a somewhat healthy Hot Pocket, and it is very similar! I thoroughly enjoyed the dill flavor in the crust, and the smoked salmon on the inside was fresh, it felt like it had just come out of the oven! I also tried the smoked mozzerella, mushroom, and broccoli and that tasted more like a calzone to me, but still equally as great! The only downside is that this seems to be one of the most popular places in the market and there is often a long line. Be prepared to wait about 15 minutes. It is worth the wait though, I can't wait to come back and try more of their flavors!"

I literally have nothing bad to say relating to this area; the piroshky is consistently fresh and the staff is consistently friendly. I have not attempted all of the many distinct flavors of piroshky, but the ones I 've had (which contain the steak and cheese, rhubarb, cinnamon and cardomon braid, cranberry apple, and basic steak) are amazing! They do not constantly have borscht, but when they do it's also excellent and I highly recommend it."

This small hole in the wall definitely lives up to the concept of a double banquet! Situated on exactly the same side of the road as the first Starbucks across from Pike's Place Market, Piroshky Piroshky serves up pastries filled with either salty or sweet ingredients. My favorites include the Apple Cinnamon Roll as well as the Cheese Onion Garlic Roll. They're REALLY SO great!!!"

You might like beef and cheese more than I do but I guess I grew up with a bit of Jew in me because I don't like how those ingredients mix.

The first time I had it was at the Bumbershoot festival last year. It was freshly made, and the guy gave it to me right out of the fryer. I had the salmon piroshky, shaped like a fish (uber cute). It was sooo good, I went back for another one. Some time later, I was craving another one, so I went by the shop in Pike's Market. It just wasn't the same. sad face. It was still good, but just didn't taste as fresh? I got the same salmon one, but the fish seemed a bit dried out and wasn't as creamy as the one i had at the festival.

This charming bakery is known for its diverse and flavorful piroshkies, and it certainly lives up to its reputation.My personal favorite was the cheese and meat piroshky - a warm, hearty parcel filled with aromatic spices. It was the perfect way to kick-start our day of exploration. The taste still lingers in my memory, making me crave another bite.Another standout item was the Vatrushka, a house specialty. This delectable treat consists of house-made dough topped with marionberries & sweet cream cheese, all dusted with powdered sugar. It was sweet without being cloying, and the marionberries added a delightful tanginess that played off the creamy cheese perfectly.Don't let the line intimidate you - Piroshky Piroshky is more than worth the wait.

I really like this kind of ""carry and go"" food. And this place has what it perfect for hanging out in the market. Everything is kinda a ghost town right now, but this is one of my favorite things to get in the market on a sunny day. With spring coming on fast, I'm hoping I can get back down there to buy a couple of their piroshkies. I've had a bunch of different kinds, and no matter what stuffing you get, they are FANTASTIC. Definitely recommend these guys!!!!"

Amazing prices, out of this country taste! Salmon piroshky the best). It is worth driving across town for, however, parking is sparse which is surprising because it's located inside pike place mnarket. It's a great place to come and sit outside on a sunny day or take to go and eat in nearby Park Place Market."

Soooooo like any responsible person, I came back later.Upon return, the line was all gone! We walked right up and ordered a salmon something, something salmon and delicious. We only bought one, and we loved it. This is definitely worth the stop. It's nestled among many other places that suck tourists in, but this one is the truth. It's worth the stop.It's located right across from the public market; you can't miss it. Look for the line--and get there early! ;-D"

I didn't know what it yet was but I had to have it! I got in line and saw the different kinds of pastries and knew this was going to be an awesome place to snack! The bread not only smells good but tastes amazing! The light crispness and softness of the bread just filled me with joy when taking that first bite. From the freshness to the flavor, I felt I was in heaven. Living in California we definitely have good bakeries but this place is definitely unique to the flavor. So wishing there was one here!"

These things are amazing and there are so many options. I will count down the clock with my work mates to run down and grab one and sit and chat with while grubbing. I love the beef and cheese.

If I'm looking for something savory, I always grab the Smoked Salmon Pate Piroshky but if I have a sweet tooth that day, the Moscow Roll hits the spot. The location is nice as I can grab a pastry then stroll the stalls at Pike Place Market."

Piroshky, Piorshky, you are a delightful, savory, devil that will haunt my food dreams. I stuck to the savory items, and although I can't recall the actual name, my favorite was one that had about a bazillion diced up mushrooms in it. I had two, although I wish I had, had the balls to order 4 and let the world judge me how they saw fit. There were some sweet options as well--- one looked like a death star, I abstained given my preference to gorge myself on savory, but it looked great. Also, a fun line to wait in. Part of the experience right?!"

We tried the potato and mushroom, and a chocolate and hazelnut piroshky. Both were delicious, but the potato and mushroom one was particularly flavorful and tasty. The atmosphere was good too.

This is my last day in Seattle and work is carrying me off again. I wanted to leave with a belly full of delicious food and I knew this had to be the place. The crust is perfectly flaky and they are filled to bust. My favorites have to be the beef and onion, the cabbage and onion, and the beef and cheese. The cherry chocolate is always the perfect end. Sometimes the lines are long, *usually* but sometimes if you hit it at the right time, you'll be in and out. Don't let the lines discourage you, it's worth the wait (most good food is). I will certainly miss you and I hope my journey across the country brings me back here again one day."

You won't be disappointed in the place.I didn't know what a piroshky was until I was at a Seafair party 10+ years ago. That's when JEN COLLINS made some for the party and I became a major fan of piroshkies. Jen passed away a few years ago. When I come to PP I think of JEN. This review is dedicated to JEN."

Definitely doesn't disappoint! The treats we bought the first day were so great, we came 2 days in a row. First day we lucked out in the afternoon with no line. Next day, we went to get coffee at the first Starbucks in the world next door and got caught up in the morning rush in a 20 minute Piroshky line. My favorite was the salmon pate, a fish shaped pastry filled with tasty salmon pate; it was a first for me, and quite satisfying. I also tried the beef and cheese, ham, cheese, and spinach, smoked mozzarella, mushroom, and broccoli, and apple cinnamon roll, all recommended by other Yelpers, but out of all of them, the salmon pate was in my opinion the most flavorful and suited to my taste. Though the other pastries didn't become my favorite, they were all worth a try. You'll experience various pastry textures and consistencies;"

If you have never had a piroshok (I think they are called?) then you are in for a treat like I was. Basically they are mini pies with ingredients like meat, veggies, and other things inside. They are flakey and crunchy and filled with all sorts of things. My recommendation is the mushroom, chicken, and rice, the flavors mixed so well with the bread. Also the cranberry apple piroshki were a great dessert, although I guess they are technically not a desert.The bottom line is go here, eat, and you will enjoy."

Everytime I go I pick a sweet and a savory one. I know, I know, serious artery blocker. My favorite is still the smoked salmon piroshky. I usually end up at the Market and just follow the smell. Seriously, a classic. Always great."
Piroshky Piroshky,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/piroshky-piroshky-seattle?not_recommended_start=880,Mary S.,5.0,7/14/2013,4,WA,"Very very busy, but for good reason. The piroshky have amazing crusts, and then filled with flavors such as salmon, broccoli cheese, and cream of mushroom, and sweet Piroshky such as rhubarb and chocolate. There seem to be different types of crust for different types of fillings. I find two savory and one sweet piroshky splits well between 2 people.You will need to stand in line, or go on a slow day (some weekday during the winter when the skies are dark). Then, there is not seating, so you will have to take your piroshky and flee to somewhere more comfortable. If you explore Pike Place, you will find that there is public seating available, or coffee shops you can occupy. If you go straight back and to the left of the Piroshky place, you can find some small amount of public seating, and if that is full, across the street there is a nice park (although someone tried to sell me drugs last time I went there, which might make tourists more uncomfortable).You might wonder if this hassle is worth it. I would say yes. The closest I've found elsewhere is savory pies, but never of the same quality. They are high quality, quirky, but simple, and very Seattle to me. Besides, sometimes standing in line with a bunch of other people excited to experience a place is what you need to convince yourself to pay attention to what you are eating."

Try something here. Who doesn't like stuff wrapped in a light flaky dough. The smell of the place was what got me so enticed. The place is a tiny spot in one of the buildings of the market. The wife really liked this place at it reminded her of her grandmothers meat pies as a kid. So we only tried the one beef and onion, but we couldn't be happier. This thing was heavenly. Just one more bite was all I wanted and then when it was all gone, I almost ran back from the hotel to get another one. Will have to try another one before leaving town."

We tried the Apple Cinnamon Roll, Beef & Cheese, Chocolate Hazelnut roll, and their Potato Mushroom & Onion. Out of the 4, the beef and cheese was the best, BUT everything else was good.

Pike's Place itself is an experience, but you never know if tourist spots will have good food. Piroshky's perogies are delish. The line is worth waiting in and moves fast. A perogie is a Russian pie. I had the salmon pate and dill perogie. It was piping hot and flaky, buttery soft. I would order these to have in Texas! For dessert I had an apple cinnamon made with green apples. It was full of big chunks of delicious fresh, apple. It was an affordable lunch for just about $8. Be prepared to eat standing up, unless you can find a bench somewhere around the shops."

Vons did not disappoint. I started with the smoked cherry Manhattan and the salmon chowder. The flavor of the salmon chowder was awesome I thoroughly enjoyed it. The bacon chunks caught me by surprise but overall still a great meal. The cherry Manhattan was a bit too sweet for my liking but luckily for me the Monday special was traditional manhattans, so of course I indulged. The traditional manhattan was a crowd favorite and made with love. Highly recommend this place for drinks, ambience, and food. The service was also excellent."

However, the waiter's response left me baffled as he kept mentioning he would ""add on"" to the drink. Confused but willing to trust his expertise, I let it slide.When our drinks finally arrived, I couldn't help but feel like I was sipping on colored water. It seemed like my custom concoction had gone awry. My husband, who ordered his usual Hendricks gin and tonic, was met with a diluted disappointment. We're no strangers to this drink, and this one was exceptionally watered down. In summary, I would advise you to bypass the drinks altogether at this establishment. While the cocktails may leave much to be desired, the food is an entirely different story. We had the ""bang bang chicken"" and a serving of shredded pork fries, both bursting with flavor. If you're dining here, save your money for the delectable dishes and opt for tap beers or bottled drinks if you're in the mood. Skip the bartender's experiments"

Great service.Went here for dinner as a group of 4 people. Even for a Friday night 9pm, the wait was minimal (5mins) which was a pleasant surprise considering this is a popular place. They have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating available.Ordered 6 plates of 4 different types of food items: burrata, hummus, bang bang chicken, chicken wings. The food was quite good. Nothing to die for, but good. Chicken wings could have been better. The drinks were fine as well. Some of them have additional presentation added like a mini firecracker (picture attached).Service was fantastic. With 6 food plates shared in 4 people, and 2-3 drinks per person, the total cost price was $70 per person (including tips taxes)."

What is simply amazing is that the place offers an opportunity to choose from a variety of dishes and desserts. What is more is that the establishment has a dancing arena. This is just cool. I recall how beautiful it was enjoying our meals and watching people dance to some good slow music. From my experience I feel that the place not only feeds the body but it also feeds the heart.

The Classic burger was awesome! Trying to be somewhat ""wholesome"" I asked for no bun and they set it over a fresh green salad...which was AMAZING! I tasted a few of the chips which were some of the finest I Have had in awhile. I saw lots of the pizza's coming out and while dining with my father we understood we should have mixed it up a bit and not gotten the same thing!

The patty was cooked to perfection--juicy, flavorful, and with a slight char that added a smoky depth. The sourdough bun (a signature at Von's) was soft yet sturdy, with a subtle tang that complemented the burger perfectly. The toppings were fresh and well-balanced: crisp lettuce, ripe tomato, melty cheese, and just the right amount of their house-made sauce.I also appreciated the side of hand-cut fries, which were crispy on the outside and fluffy inside--just the way I like them. Paired with one of their craft cocktails, it was an absolutely satisfying meal.The atmosphere added to the experience: casual yet stylish, with great service and a lively vibe.

The flavors were balanced, the quality was superb, and each dish left us wanting just one more bite.From start to finish, the service was top-notch.

The Original Mac & 4 Cheeses is a standout dish, featuring sourdough pasta made in-house, a creamy and amazing cheese sauce, and perfectly complementary breadcrumbs on top--definitely a must-try. The Quatre Viande Pizza boasts an excellent dough with a crunchy yet soft crust and savory toppings balanced by a subtly sweet tomato sauce. The Hass Avocado & Billionaire's Bacon burger is another winner, with juicy beef, flavorful bacon, and avocado that ties everything together perfectly. The Seattle Seafood Stew has a comforting tomato flavor, with flakey cod, well-cooked clams, and fluffy focaccia for dipping, though the stew's overall flavor is somewhat muted. For dessert, the Vanilla Ice Cream, served with a huge sparkler for my birthday, was fresh with a noticeable vanilla bean taste, though a bit icy in texture which I personally enjoyed.The interior is dimly lit and cozy, creating a warm atmosphere. It gets packed around dinnertime, which is a good sign because it means the food is good! The service was generally good despite the busy environment; the wait time was shorter than expected, and the staff was friendly and helpful, even if the waitress couldn't check in as often as desired. Overall, Von's 1000 Spirits provides a great dining experience with its delicious food and friendly service."

Firstly our server Spencer was perfect he was so kind and funny really made our night special. The wings were tangy but not too spicy and the fries are delicious.

Wish I tried their original location. Most of their dishes were too salty. My favorite was the nasi lemak, had the right texture, balance in flavor, and nice plating. Would skip the pineapple and cucumber salad, mine had mainly pineapple and just tastes like tajin and fish sauce, can simple make at home. The fried chicken wings were dry and simple, would pass on that as well. Food portions were small for the price.Staff were friendly, checked up on us often and gave good recommendations. Their reservation system was convenient. Decorations were pretty and welcoming. A nice spot to take friends to."

I mean, I've seen some impressive bartenders in my time, but these two take the cake (or should I say, the cocktail)!First off, let's talk about the happy hour - it was like a magical potion of joy and discounted drinks. I don't know how they do it, but Taylor and Erick managed to turn an ordinary evening into a fabulous fiesta! And the drinks? Oh boy, they were so tasty that I almost wanted to order one of each just to taste the rainbow of flavors. I'm pretty sure they secretly sprinkle a little bit of unicorn dust in every glass.Now, let's not forget the atmosphere - it was as lively as a pack of party animals on a Friday night! I don't know if it was Taylor and Erick's magnetic personalities or just the fact that they make drinks that are pure liquid happiness, but the place was buzzing with good vibes.Overall, my experience with Taylor and Erick at Vons 1000 Spirits was nothing short of amazing. They're like the Batman and Robin of bartending - except instead of fighting crime, they're fighting sobriety! If you want a good time, tasty drinks, and an atmosphere that feels like a non-stop party, look no further than these two maestros of mixology. Cheers to Taylor and Erick - you both were absolutely fabulous!!"

I came in just after checking into the hotel around lunch time and was surprised to find a full and bustling bar with the coolest kitchen and tons of cool stuff to look at everywhere! Josh, the host was warm and welcoming handed me menus and pointed me to the bar upon request. I was greeted with a warm friendly smile by Jess the bartender and a personal pitcher of nice cold water without first requesting. I was excited after reading the menu and asked Jess for some recommendations on a house cocktail and some lunch options. She suggested the old fashioned alternative they called ""The Leatherbound,"" and after a lovely rundown of the menu I decided on the Tellicherry Chicken pasta dish, which came out in superhero time. I was blown away with BOTH my drink and my pasta dish. Sabrina, the other bartender, came over to check on me just after my food was delivered- there was absolutely nothing that could have made my lunch any closer to perfection. The atmosphere was rocking throughout the restaurant, everyone was smiling and the service was incredible! I unfortunately had to go off to a work meeting for the rest of the day followed by an early flight home in the morning so I couldn't experience more cocktails and what looks to be a fantastic menu. The only bad part was leaving this little treasure I had just discovered. Thank you for a wonderful, even if brief, experience. I wish there were more establishments just like this one!"

As soon as I walked in the door, I was greated by a lovely young host. I think her name was Zia? She took the time to find accommodations for my group. There were 6 of us on a busy Friday night, yet she was able to find us a table almost immediately, to our delight. Our server, Elizabeth, was a wealth of knowledge on their spirit collection ( Yes they really have over 1 thousand) and was able to recommend each of us great drinks to try. Having already been impressed, to food left me speechless. Their ""Mac n 4 cheeses"" was decadent. The perfect amount of rich, not to mention how delicious their house made sourdough pasta is! My wife had Avocado Bacon burger and was equally satisfied. It safe to say me and my family will be back soon!"

Their sourdough pesto pasta was delicious! What I really appreciated was that our server, Traci, took the time to explain all her favorite key dishes to us when we were having difficulty deciding over the incredible menu choices.What really stood out to me as a patron was the care she took with our kids at the table. My daughter loves mac and cheese but there was no option for it on the kids menu. Without hesitation Traci said she could modify a kids pasta to make as mac and cheese. She did give warning that the mac and cheese would be a bit spicy but my daughter was elated at the idea of mac and cheese. Wouldn't you know it, as children do, my daughter changed her mind after one bite. Apologetically I explained the situation to our server when she came to the table after the food was delivered. Traci was more than happy to replace my child's meal with an alternative cream sauce, which my daughter loved, and the new dish was out within minutes of my request. As a parent it is always an adventure to go out with your children because you can never anticipate how long their attention will be kept before they are ALL DONE and want to move on.

I originally made reservations for party of 6, that changed to 8. I called and spoke to Dan the GM and he meet our needs for a table of 8. Dan went above and beyond to ensure our table was what we wanted. Huge selection of spirits as the name says. Highly recommend this place. Ainura was our server and she was top notch. Prompt service and attention to detail was in point. Every 30mins the bar spins a wheel for a discount drink price. Our table had the following: pulled pork Mac and cheese (2 orders), pulled pork fries, salmon pasta, salmon chowder, salmon fish and chips (3 orders), and hamburger. The entire party would come back. My only regret is that we waiting till our last night in town to come here. PS. Don't forget to get the beignets. They are amazing."

I ate at Bobby Flays restaurant in Vegas as well as had the ""famous"" burger of Gordon Ramsay.. the burger here put both to shame. Best food I have EVER had ( I've eaten around the world, I did not expect to say that about Seattle). The atmosphere was incredible- unique and classy yet edgy, fun and chaotic without being boisterous, a mystery without being complicated. The staff (ask for Gabby!!) was beyond helpful as well as knowledgable, attentive without being annoying; impeccable service. The manager was out and about, the entire place was so genuine it was almost hard to believe. I would give more stars if I could, AMAZING experience.

I drive all the way into Seattle just to go here which is about 20 minutes out. When I think about going to Pike's, I know Von's is waiting. I love the decor, the lighting, the food, the drinks..........AND, dun da da DAAAAAhhhhh, the beignet's are little cushions of happy. I was out and about doing some photography when started to get a little hungry, plus it was beer-thirty. The glowing sign peeked out and caught my attention. I went in to order a stout and the cinnamon sugar beignets and from that moment I was hooked. I knew, just from the menu, there was more deliciousness to come. I wasn't wrong.  They have an aged old eloquent selection of liquors on a lovely glass shelf with little cards that indicate what it is and pricing, plus a full bar, and nice beer on tap. They have really good cocktails and it's always fun to spin the wheel and see what you can get a discount on for the next thirty minutes. The staff is really nice and accommodating and I just have the best time when I go in there. The burgers are unique and good, the pizza is amazing, the pasta is delicious, and the salmon soup/stew with a nice chunk of sourdough soaking in the bowl is heavenly. I've ordered that twice. It's just great and I'm running out of adjectives to describe it. Just go in, sit down, and enjoy yourself."

It was incredibly expensive for the items we good which again were not edible. We are physically ill and would never ever eat her again.

Ryan Santwire (the owner) is a prime example of an exploitive culture vulture who profits off of a stolen brand and cuisine. The food doesn't compare to the original, especially the caramelized onions, which are bland.

That ""Roasted Pork"" is being cooked too damn fast. Its tough, not tender. No matter how much mayo you slather on that sandwich, you can't hide the truth. Braising pork takes time, I know you have to make a lot of it, but what is the point if you are just going to half ass it. Not to mention, nobody in that joint looks happy to be there. Whats up y'all, not paying your people enough? Hiring people who will accept your crappy wages and work environment over people who should get paid more and will make better food. Something isn't working, you guys, pull your heads out of your techie culitos and get with the programa. The equation isn't that hard."

I've had a few (to say the least) Cuban sandwiches in my day so I'm no stranger to what authentic should taste like.I ordered the press and a side of rice + beans.

The Paseo magic left with the original owners. Sure it is the same name, but, usually when a restaurant is purchased the previous owners teach the new owner's the recipes and techniques. This is obviously NOT the case. The new owner poached the place in the hallway of a courthouse auction. The food tastes like a Bellevue version of Cuban food - bland, dry, and lacks originality. We will miss you original Paseo. Yes, it was #2 with the previous owners. Definitely not number two under this ownership that purchased it in a hallway auction WITHOUT the recipes. Pathetic."

It takes more than the same bread company and same meat vendor to be the original sandwich. I think it is also a joke of the picture of the ethnic people, how desperate is the owner to show past workers are returning. I went there a lot every week, I didn't recognize one face or person.

I've eaten here about 25 times already, and the sandwiches are always fucking BOMB!!! But I must say, service has gone downhill. Wait times have increased from 15 minutes (About 2 years ago) to now 30-60 minutes. The workers are slow as fuck. They look stoned to hell (Hey I use to smoke and work at fast food too) and are slow to take your order and don't really give a shit about you. The napkins and hand sanitizer wipes were empty when I was there recently, and I told them about it and it took them 15 minutes to refill them. It's like the owners of Paseos knows everybody loves their food, they're bringing in hoards of cash with their low overhang and endless stream of customers, so FUCK CUSTOMER SERVICE cause these PASEO ADDICTED FIENDS will ALWAYS come back for more.I also have a conspiracy theory on how they create artificial drug like demand. After 5pm, they usually run out of fucking bread. Tell me, how fucking hard is it to get BREAD!?!?! It's fucking bread. It's not some magic Cuban bread that falls out the sky when the Earth's hemispheres hits a certain longitude. How hard is it to send some 19 year old pothead to GO GET MORE FUCKING BREAD!?!? It's like they run out of bread purposely, so you get PISSED and return the next day ready to double your order to make up for yesterday's waste of time. And they know your succulent pork morsel addicted crackfiend ass will be BACK the NEXT DAY ready to order again.I'm starting to wonder if Paseos is owned by a Cuban druglord and his business is simply a front to launder cash....o.O*Disclosure* I went to Paseos today and they ran out of fucking bread.

If you just drove by and didn't know what it was, you'd think it's a food bank, seeing how many hungry-looking folks standing in line.Anyways, my curiosity got the best of me and I got in the long line and waited for 40 minutes, paid $9 for the Caribbean Roast sandwich and waited for another 20 minutes for my order to be ready. For a finger food joint, it's hideous, yo!!And it was a disappointing experience. To be fair, the pork was very good with a hint of soy sauce used in its aioli marinade. The caramelized onion gave good flavor and a nice texture to the combination while the lettuce provided an overall freshness. The bread was baked to near perfection. But the sandwich looked obnoxious. Because it's made from a stupid recipe. The hard bread a la French baguette isn't meant to be made into a sandwich, let alone with heavy fillings. That's why it's so messy to eat. The Vietnamese Banh mi, on the other hand, is made from a modified French baguette with rice flour added to the dough, and the bread and the fillings are rather light.   The Paseo sandwich is neither traditional nor authentic. It should be called the random sandwich instead, because no one can trace its origin to the Caribbean, Cuba or even Miami. There's nothing Caribbean or Cuban about the sandwiches at Paseo. For all I care, it can be called the Nigerian sandwich or whatever. It's a faux ethnic food item, just like the infamous fortune cookies. For some strange reasons, the joint has become quite popular here in North Seattle. But I'm not a masochist and I don't like waiting for an hour for a kid-sized meal, where ever the hell it came from. I wasn't impressed at all and I think the place is a fraud with all its pretentiousness."

It would have been nice had he pulled his head out and said "" you know, we're out of sandwiches, again, I'm sorry about that...here's the deal...we just don't have room to store extra bread...or meat...or whatever"" as opposed to just ""yeah..we're out""...I know you're out, I'm more curious to know why after running out so consistently you don't prep for more sandwiches. Anyway...after I get around to eating one (it's been a year since my last go around) I'll write a proper food review. But until then...I've spent about $10 on gas just to hear ""yeah..we're out"""

Paseo,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paseo-seattle-11?not_recommended_start=30,Super M.,2.0,2/9/2015,1,WA,"Since I live three blocks away, I have tried five times to get the sandwich that I love. Too bad that sandwich no longer exist there anymore. I had eaten there four times a week for the last five years of my life, and I didn't recognize one face working the counter or the back kitchen. I wonder what returning employees they are always boasting about. If there was a returning employee, it wasn't someone high up in the back kitchen. Now back to the sandwich, the meat as others have posted was dry dry dry. It tasted like it was made three days ago and re-heated that morning in a watery broth. The sauce was less spicy and the bread was still pretty rock hard as usual. This all equates to someone who isn't Cuban and trying a feeble attempt at re-creating it. Yes, it looked the same with the big juicy onions but it lacked the execution, experience, and most important the love for the product. This an Americanized version of the previous sandwich. But, I feel this restaurant is not as good or the same as when owned by the previous family. I don't predict longs lines after their initial push when they opened.Also the guy working the cash register wearing the stocking hat is truly horrible. The look he gives you is sort of condescending, like I'm lucky to eat there. I guess it is probably all the tourist that don't know any better, or all the Seattlelites that only ate here once a year and can't really remember what the original version tasted like. I won't be going again for an overpriced sandwich at $12 dollars for not even half as good as it was before."

I'd been there a long time ago, so I thought I knew what to expect, but still. It was a rare hot day in Seattle, so I decided to hang out in Fremont for the afternoon. The line at Paseo was extremely long, as usual. I waited in the hot sun for about 30 minutes before getting under the shaded awning of the restaurant. The line started moving, and as I made my way to the front, I saw the dreaded sign: Cash Only. I cursed myself for forgetting they were cash sticklers, and that I was out of cash. By this point I was at the front of the line anyway. I mentioned it to the guy taking orders, and he said that he could take my order, and that I could run up the block and get cash from an ATM and come back. Not ideal, but I agreed. I ordered a scallop sandwich, then took a walk to the grocery store up the block to get cash. Twenty minutes and a $3 ATM fee later, I was back. I gingerly made my way to the front of the line again, explaining to the people who I was passing that, no, I wasn't cutting in line and taking the spot that they had waited a half an hour to claim, and that I was simply picking up an order. I paid my $10 (including tax) for my prize, handed to me rather unceremoniously in a warm plastic bag. (Side note: Aren't they banned now?) I briefly considered waiting for one of the three tables in the restaurant to clear out, but that wasn't happening. Instead, I took my sandwich down Fremont Ave., looking for any spot to stop and eat it. No park benches or appealing curbs, so my choices were a bus shelter or a dirt-covered ledge in a public park. I chose the ledge, and there, yes, I finally savored the sweet taste of victory. I sunk my teeth into the sandwich, and it was as delicious as I remembered it. For a brief second, it was all worth it. But then, the sandwich basically disintegrated on me, and on the dirty ledge where I was eating. Caramelized onions, cilantro, the garlic tapenade... they all schlooped down my hands and onto the ground. The whole thing was over in under five minutes. And there I was, stooping in a wooded park, my face and hands covered in some weird Caribbean sauce, $13 poorer and a good chunk of my afternoon gone. Honestly, it doesn't seem like a good way to spend one's time. Of the hour and a half I spent procuring, financing, and eating this sandwich, less than 10 minutes of it was pleasant. To me it's just not worth the bullshit. I would be interested in going back if they ever expanded their space, but as it is it's mostly a novelty that's best experienced once."

I don't mind waiting for long time or even slightly iffy feeling of ""cash only"" business, but the food itself was not very good. The buns were too tough, too much meat, and extremely greasy! Yes... literally I had to go through whole roll of kitchen towel to wipe my greasy while/after eating.

I really have loved this place over the years and hope they get back to the basics soon.

Still a great place to go to for a meal but the food definitely has a different taste to it now then how I remember things from when would stop in with my (aspiring) musician friends. The Caribbean Roast is still my favorite! It has been a classic here and always will be. I just wish it was a little more fluffy like the good old days.

Paseo,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paseo-seattle-11?not_recommended_start=90,Whitney B.,3.0,10/28/2013,424,WA,"I have been chasing the opportunity for a Paseo sandwich for close to a decade like a dog in heat and I finally rode the Paseo orgy train this weekend. It felt like I was handed someone else's sloppy seconds fermenting in a dirty loincloth. The unpleasant sight of my eating a Paseo sandwich ranks as one of my relationship milestones among being able to shit in your presence, comfortably talk about vaginal blood clots, and a gesture of endearment equates to nightly dutch ovens. If you are still attracted to your significant other after watching them finger-bang a Paseo Press lubricated by a jug of grease, I would consider that a real avenue of love. If one is going to fetishize a sandwich, at least have the decency to fetishize a sandwich that demonstrates immaculate culinary skills and whose bread isn't a gigantic crouton. Luckily, we came in early enough to avoid all of the other thirsty asses. Had we arrived any later, I think we would have spent at least 30 minutes waiting in line for an under-seasoned, overcooked sandwich. I would rather asphyxiate myself with plastic wrap. Dare I say that the Paseo Press and Caribbean Roast both had overcooked, chewy pork and terrifyingly under-performed in regards to flavor and taste overall. I am stunned at how something can be so freakishly oily and awfully bland at the same time. The only ounce of flavor I tasted was one pickled jalapeño that fell out of my sandwich, as with everything else to the point where it deconstructed itself. Customers ought to file a license in order to be in public with an unconcealed weapon that is the bread of a Paseo sandwich. Shit's terrible as sandwich bread, it's super dense and hard to chew. The pressure you have to apply to gnaw at the bread forces the pork and other insides to fall out. Stupid. I did prefer the Caribbean Roast far more than the Paseo Press because it had the lettuce and mayonnaise, which counteracted the pork jerky. Paseo is running on a fine line between a tolerable sandwich stop and an overrated fartbag. I am going to give Paseo the benefit of the doubt because it might have been an off day for whomever prepared the pork in the back; however, it seems that they are consistent with inconsistencies with either service or the food. I would hardly worship the grounds on which they erect their 10-person capacity shacks."

Messy foods always tend to be quality and good. However, the need to stand in a long line and wait to get this sandwich is lost on me.

I am very picky to the food I want eat so I don't like their sandwiches. The place is very nice and the people around us enjoy the food they eat.. It's just me who don't want I think. So it's just OK with me.

Less than a minute a person. There had to be about 25 people in front of me, but I waited only 15-20 minutes. I had the pulled pork sandwich. Amazing and large. The beans should have been called bean soup because they were very watery... still flavorful though. I didn't like that the cuban food was served on chinese style plates... I think they can afford better dish ware for the profit they are turning. My biggest problem with them was the long line and small amount of seating. I hope they move to a bigger location soon."

The combination of tender roast beef, tangy Caribbean spices, and fresh vegetables made for a truly unforgettable taste experience.The sandwich itself was generously sized, and the bread was perfectly toasted to add a nice crunch to each bite. But what really stood out was the incredibly juicy and tender meat, which was cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor.Unfortunately, I can't give the same glowing review for the wings I tried. While they were decent, they were just ordinary and didn't quite measure up to the outstanding flavors of the Caribbean roast sandwich.Overall, I highly recommend giving the Caribbean roast sandwich a try if you're in the mood for something truly special. It's a definite 4/5 stars in my book!"

There's lots of places to go to if you know Seattle. Their sandwiches are amazing. I get the Caribbean every time. It's HUGE and quite greasy but that's okay. It is a bit pricey at 9.75... but it's worth it! The braised pork is amazingggg!! It melts in your mouth. The onions are really good too. I'm not much of a big chunks of onion person, but they're so sweet and not too sweet. Just perfect!"

I despise basic breakfast/brunch foods. Being a home cook, I want something a bit more original and complex that I haven't made at home a million times.The setting is in a perfect location. Fremon t a nice walking yuppie area where everyone pretends to be yoga/pilates experts in their Lulu outfits they may or may not have actually worked out in. It was beautiful weather so I asked to sit out front, but the place is SO light and airy inside that I would have gladly sat in there instead.A couple great bloody marys, some avocado, and perfect size portions and we were done! Would love to explore their regular menu as well. Flavors were simple yet complex enough to be interesting and satisfying.The only drawback of a lunch h is the ""lunch crowd"". The most painfully basic conversations about their cliche night before, drivel about the pointless rest of their day, or people practically making out with random dogs walking by. But, that is to be expected and this restaurant does not hold exclusivity in cheesy people!"

Sure there are some improvements like the fact that they take credit cards. But the food is like 90% the same. There's just something that's not exactly the same. It's a little bit more tangy than before. The flavors from the jalapeños come through a lot more. They also wrap the sandwiches differently. Put together it still makes for a good experience, but it's still not quite the original legend."

The roasted pork is a piece of heaven on a crunchy roll. The onions should not legally be characterized with the other onions you've ever had. The wait can be long, there is nowhere to wait, and they are cash only, but I'd be back in a heartbeat for the tasty delight."

Paseo,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paseo-seattle-11?not_recommended_start=180,James G.,4.0,5/18/2015,5,WA,"I came here for lunch at 2:15PM on a Friday, assuming it would be empty; I was shocked to find a long line out the door, even with the threat of rain looming.Obviously, this place is well-known, and for good reason. We ended up waiting about 45 minutes to order, and another 15-20 to receive our food after that. The line went fast enough, and the cashier at the front was very courteous, unlike what I would expect in a similar situation in New York City.I got the Caribbean Roast sandwich, which is their specialty. I have to say: it is the best sandwich I have had in my life to date. I was hard-pressed to think of a sandwich that was that close, honestly. The famous cheesesteaks of Philadelphia were no match; only a deli sandwich from 2nd Ave Deli in NYC is close, but no cigar.There is so much going on in this sandwich. The pork is sopping with juice and flavor. The aioli adds a pop, and the caramelized onions add some sweetness and complexity. Add some cilantro and romaine for a little bit of balance and a lightly toasted baguette and this thing is damn close to perfect. Keep in mind, though: it is near impossible to eat without making a tremendous mess. Be prepared to be covered in sauce, but you won't mind."

It was very good and craved for another, but at the time I went back a few weeks later, they were closed for a vacation. Yikes! A coworker told me about a sack lunch box lunch whatever delivery company that they had ordered from in the North called Eclectic. I was weary, because who could compete with Seattle's best sandwich? I gave them a call and they said that they would deliver to our company the following day (24 hours notice is required for all orders). Holy $%#! Their Cubano was a taste that lingered in my mouth! It wasn't Paseo's #2 but more along the lines of Paseo's press, (but not pressed) with ham and Swiss, succulent pork and actual caramelized onions! I wish they had a storefront! If you're ever in the mood to have lunch delivered to you or your company (and can call ahead), their Cubano is other-worldly. They have other stuff too, like Chinese humbao and Vietnamese Bah Mi sandwiches, but we all ordered the Cubano and didn't regret a thing! All there items come as combos, didn't bother to ask if they sell just the sandwiches."

Ask yourself what are you waiting for? I discovered Paseo's when I signed up with yelp last year. It would be the most recommended restaurant for weeks. Like a hit song in the Top 40. I got the pirate to take me to lunch here. So we had the Pork Sandwiches since that was the Only item that did not sell out. We were lucky. They only served 6 people after us. They ran out of bread. The food here flies out like Planes out of Seatac. The sandwiches were memorable. He rarely dishes out $8.00 for something exotic. Being from the backwoods of Michigan he rarely eats anything ethnic. He usually is a cheap skate kind of guy. He really likes the $5 Subway sandwiches. So if I can get the pirate to try something new and he treats, its a win win for both parties. And like Mikey said ""He likes it !!""If your new to the area take a tip from the many locals who review restaurants online. You gotta try this place at least once. Drive, fly, crawl stand in line with the throngs of people and wait patiently. Your time will be well spent."

I'm not sure who coined that word but it probably has something to do with Paseos. Their Midnight Cuban sandwich is to DIE for. Be prepared to bring cash and you might have to wait to get a seat as the actual eating section of the establishment is rather small but for the love of God please do not pass this place up. The food melts in your mouth and their sauces are spectacular. Writing this review made my mouth water. Drop everything and find your way here. It will definitely behoove you to do so.

It's always hard with a restaurant because so many things can affect your perception of the place. I have to say though, as objectively as I can, my meal was good. Real good. I think people get a little crazy with the five stars around here. They start handing them out like bread loaves at a soup kitchen. A five star hotel is a place you stay that makes you want to not go home to your wife and kids. A five star meal is a dinner that makes you want to cut out your tongue afterwards so you don't have to suffer a mediocre meal ever again. This place is a solid four.

There's a lot of good options here so you're gonna have to try each one to decide your favorite, however in my opinion the caribbean pulled pork roast takes the cake. It can get pretty busy as this place has now become a Seattle staple, but its always worth the wait. I've been coming to the Fremont location for years now and I'm ecstatic to find out that there's a new location in Capitol Hill now as well.

It was a 2004 1-owner Tacoma TRD with 64,424 miles for less than $16,000 and had good Carfax and Autocheck reports. It also had the following features I was looking for: four wheel drive, automatic transmission, V-6 engine, TRD/SR5 road package, locking rear differential, and 2-door cab.The pickup was first listed online on March 17. We called the salesman, Mr. Curt Ritter, that afternoon and bought the pickup the next morning.  My son (who is a knowledgeable and experienced vehicle buyer) assisted with a preliminary inspection and we took the pickup on an extensive test drive. The vehicle's condition and performance were completely as advertised. A subsequent detailed inspection by an independent mechanic verified that the pickup was in very good condition with no problems. During the entire transaction, Mr. Ritter dealt with us in a friendly, straightforward, and honest manner. I would be glad to purchase another vehicle from McMinnville Toyota at any time in the future."

Be prepared to get a bit messy but don't worry you won't care mid-sandwich.

It comes with the same sauce and onions and is always light and fresh.

Even though it's been a few days since I purchased it, I am still amazed at the professionalism and straightforwardness which isn't something your ordinarily associate with car dealerships.I have been researching the car I purchased for over 6 months and I knew the price I wanted to pay. I checked with over 20 Honda dealer who all flatly turned me down. I recently got an email from Nick Cruthers telling me that he could come very close to the price I wanted to pay. I sent his offer to all the other dealers - not one of them said they could even match it, let alone beat it, and a few suggested that Mr. Cruthers wasn't being entirely honest with me.I drove out of South Tacoma Honda having financed the car at exactly what I wanted to pay. They didn't try to force me to pay any other fees, etc. Of course they offered accessories and other stuff, but I refused everything - and they still smiled and treated me like a king. I am pleased to tell you that Mr Cruthers has my ringing endorsement. He couldn't have made the process easier."

Mind you, we were so hungry and tired, the walk from our hostel to Paseo was a little longer than we expected, we waited about 20 minutes in the long line to order and about 20-30 minutes more to receive our order, walked BACK to our hostel to eat because there was no seating there, AND IT WAS STILL WORTH IT! SO DELICIOUS! We got the Paseo Press? Their most popular pressed sandwich that takes a little longer to make. It was seriously delicious. The meat, cheese, grilled onion, and whatever sauce they used went PERFECTLY together. Paseo is a MUST TRY when you're visiting Seattle and want to stop by the cute little Fremont area."

Couple of hours later John gets in touch with me to apologize and gives me great news. He's willing to do my timing belt, replace my water pump, and fix the power window at no cost. It's exactly what we expect from a professional in this type of situation. No regrets to have driven my car to the Pacific Rim Automotive at all. I'm here to testify that they will work hard to get the job nicely done no mater what. I strongly recommend the Pacific Rim Automotive for your Subaru Forester. Ask for John that it can't go wrong.

Before I left Arizona, my tattoo artist made sure to let me know about Paseo. ""Remember Paseo! That is all!"" he said in complete seriousness. So I did.My boyfriend and I got to Fremont around 9:00 a.m.--too early because nothing is open, apparently. We started at Fremont Coffee Co. and walked around a bit, then headed down to the water to find the Troll before Paseo opened at 10:30. We walked all the way up what felt like the tallest hill in the entire world before arriving at tiny Paseo around 10:00. A line was already forming, and we made friends with a gentleman named Terrence who said it was also his first time, and he would be grabbing sandwiches to-go. Everything I've read told me not to take it to-go unless you plan on wearing most of it.I intended to get the full experience. My boyfriend and I both went for the Caribbean Roast Sandwich. It took all of three minutes to get, and we even got a table! We sat, unwrapped the steaming pile of pork and went at it. It was the most satisfying greasy mess I've ever had the pleasure of wearing all over my face and hands. The jalapenos scattered throughout offered the perfect kick to the mild flavor of the pork. The baguette was crisp and stayed that way!I looked around the room and noticed not two people eat a Paseo sandwich the same way. While we opted for the ""face first"" method, one man had grabbed a fork and taken off the top part of the sandwich, scooping sauce and pork in single-bite increments. Another gent had used a fork entirely. Some a bag, already slightly spotted with grease, to-go. It was magical to see everyone so satisfied!It turned out to be a good thing we walked a hundred blocks up a gigantic hill to get to Paseo because we were absolutely full to the brim after. I would walk up that hill a million times over just to get to that sandwich. You have quite the gem, Seattle!!"

When friends come into town to visit, this is a place I try to take them to. And at first, I didn't get it, it was just a sandwich that tasted normal. But the more I have it, the more it sticks out to me. Fair warning for those having it the first time, this is a greasy sandwich so load up on napkins. I usually go for the Cuban Roast, as it's what they tout as their most popular. Comes with HUGE slices of onions, a leaf of lettuce and some juicy savory pork. Can't figure out what the sauce is either, is it just mayo? In any case, the bite goes down so good and the jalapenos add the heat that I look for in any great sandwich. I would consider getting extra jalapenos next time.A tip if you plan on heading there is call in an order beforehand. After about half an hour, you can walk right in and pick it up instead of waiting in line. I've waited for an hour and half before."

OMG I can still remember the sandwichy goodness exploding with every bite. They roasted it and toasted it and it was just lovely the way it worked out. I couldn't get enough it. Each bite was better than the one before. If it were legal I would marry the sandwich.
Paseo,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paseo-seattle-11?not_recommended_start=780,Borja B.,5.0,10/23/2013,6,WA,I walked in skeptical and left a believer in the power of meat between bread. It is so difficult to explain the sheer joy one receives from getting a sandwich from a well managed restaurant with fresh ingredients. It was as if I was blind my whole life and then suddenly I saw colors for the first time. I recommend the Italian sandwich sprinkled with basil and lightly toasted for perfection and a well rounded meal. After each bite remember to cleanse your palate after each bite with a crisp spring water. This way each time you chew it is nothing but flavor explosions in your mouth.

The pub itself has a great atmosphere, with solid vibes that make it a nice spot to hang out.One of the highlights was the extensive drink options available. They had a wide selection of drinks to choose from, catering to various preferences. The service was quick and friendly, adding to the overall positive experience. The staff was attentive without being intrusive, making sure we had everything we needed.The prices were fair for the quality and quantity of food and drinks provided.

re:public,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/re-public-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=20,Jessica R.,4.0,8/9/2014,4,WA,"Strolled in for brunch midday on a Saturday, not really knowing what to expect. I had previewed a brunch menu online that looked like it was on point, but I was really sold by the fact that they take online reservations for brunch - unheard of in Seattle - and all I really wanted was some good food in a decent atmosphere without the hours long wait that generally trademark brunch in this city.While this is certainly one of the many dinner/bar locations that brunch offerings are clearly their second line of business, with ""brunch"" written on a chalkboard for diners to take notice while they are in for a drink on a Friday night, I was pleasantly surprised at the airiness of the place with the roll-up opened on a nice summer day.Service was great - timely, thoughtful, and kind. Mimosas were generous in the champagne department and were mixed with fresh oj. And the food - THE FOOD! I ordered the beef short rib chilaquiles and the hubs ordered the fried chicken/waffle. The chilaquiles were delicious! Topped with radish and cilantro, a side of black brand with cotija cheese, and served with crème fraîche, a lime wedge, and green ""diablo salsa"" - just the right amount of heat. The fried chicken and waffle were also amazing - the chicken was juicy on the inside and had perfectly crispy skin, and the waffle was sprinkled with pecans and bacon and topped with a cardamon butter that was to die for! The perfect sweet/savory brunch item.If you're looking for a fabulous brunch without the wait, re:public is now definitely on the top of my list."

The red letters on the sign make it that much more magical. Anywho, we had a private company event here and I definitely indulged. The ambiance was very romantic so I could definitely see myself cruising here for a nice glass of vino on a weekend or weekday with a sweet lil' thang.I had the crab puffs as an appetizer and they were quite scrumptious, some amazing lasagna and pasta for my entree. After I was almost all the way full I tried their rib eye and was immediately blown away. This place wasn't too pricey so definitely worth your time if you're in the area.Bonus info: This is about 1 notch up from Joey's in SLU. It's more expensive so I would recommend Joey's if you're just having drinks and/or a light appetizer and Re:Public if you want a higher class menu and ambiance."

Yep, most amazing thing I have ever had in my entire life. I couldn't tell if I was eating a meal or a dessert, omg, if you guys are reading this please, please bring it back! I have only sat at the bar, but service is always attentive even when its busy. Until last week I was only in on weekday nights, but I stopped by for a martini by myself on a friday and it was packed!

Purple Cafe and Wine Bar,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/purple-caf%C3%A9-and-wine-bar-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=0,Manny S.,1.0,11/26/2023,1,CA,"I recently visited Purple Café and Wine Bar in Seattle for the first time, and unfortunately, my experience left much to be desired. While the ambiance and drink selection were noteworthy, my overall impression was tainted by uncomfortable seating, lackluster food, and an unpleasant aftermath.Let's start with the positives. The restaurant's ambiance and wine selection create a cozy and sophisticated atmosphere, making it a suitable spot for drinks and socializing. However, when it comes to the dining experience, there are considerable drawbacks.The seating arrangement was notably uncomfortable, detracting from what could have been an enjoyable evening. The chairs lacked ergonomic design, making it difficult to relax and fully savor the dining experience.Turning to the food, I ordered the chicken, expecting a premium dish given the prices. Regrettably, the reality fell short of expectations. The chicken was disappointingly dry, reminiscent of a budget BBQ chicken one might find at a grocery store. The lack of succulence and flavor left me questioning the value for the cost.Unfortunately, my disappointment did not end with the underwhelming meal. The next day, I experienced persistent gas and an upset stomach. While I'm not quick to attribute these symptoms solely to the restaurant, it does raise concerns about the quality of ingredients or food handling practices.In light of my overall dissatisfaction and the subsequent digestive discomfort, I believe the establishment should consider refunding my purchase. A dining experience should leave patrons satisfied and comfortable, and unfortunately, Purple Café and Wine Bar fell short of these expectations."

Waiter was rude and beligerant, and turned a celebration for our son's camp getaway into a miserable experience. It was so bad we walked out of the restaurant before ordering anything, even though we had no other place to go. Terrible, and sad. Management didn't care, and their fake empathy towards us was even more insulting, even as they realized the ridiculodness of the situation. Too bad, we have been there before and liked it. We will never set foot in that establishment."

The last two times I have been there in the last two months, the servers just seemed to be checked out and going through the motions. There is no passion in their work, and they are no longer trying to create an ambiance or a dining experience, and when I drop 2-300 for a dinner for 2, I expect more. I went there this evening, and again the waitress comes over with a nice bottle of wine, but where is the sommelier? Have they gotten rid of this program where the Som comes over and decants your wine. I loved talking about wine with the Som, and thought it added a nice touch. Guess Harvest Vine and Luc will now get my business. Goodbye Purple Cafe. My filet mignon was not medium, and even though I told my server, she didn't really seem to care, and I am not one to send food back unless she felt it should return to the kitchen, and she didn't say anything. The filet came by itself, so I found myself hungry afterwards and ordered two cheese tastings which were nice as always. There just isn't anything special about Purple any longer........it's just get the customer in, and get them out...............I can feel a better energy and have a special dining experience elsewhere. Seattle has some great restaurants. Sorry Purple........won't be back. GC"

This place had some of the rudest, most pretentious @$$holes I have ever met. So we went in late on a Tuesday night after a Mariners game, as my buddies sister and friend were in town from the East Coast. After ordering a shot and a drink, we were content for about 45 minutes. My buddy ordered a drink and about 20 minutes later hadn't received it. When he finally received his drink, I ordered another, and jokingly asked him if I could get it in less than a half hour. Turns out we didn't look like the crowd they prefer, so he decided that my joke meant I was intoxicated and didn't deserve to be served anymore. It was my 2nd drink in an hour, AND we had ordered food. After speaking with a manager, he agreed that I did not look intoxicated, but they don't undermine the ""judgement of their staff"". Maybe my joke was in poor taste, but I was trying to be lighthearted, not offensive, and if you work in a bar, you should be ready to deal with garbage from rude patrons, and a little banter at the bar shouldn't be handled like that. 0 stars is what they deserve,, and I guarantee I will never return to this place. I will say I was digging the atmosphere of the place before that whole thing happened."

Last night I came in excited but was very disappointed with the service. After waiting for some time to get our food, my table was finally served except for myself. Unfortunately, many of the pastas cold upon serving. I had ordered the purple chopped salad which was okay once I got it but that wasn't until 20-30 minutes after the rest of the table. By the time I was starting to eat the rest of the table was finished. Not even an acknowledgment from the waiter or an apology was given. I understand mishaps occur but I'd expect some sort of acknowledgment of it by the staff so I was not left waiting."

It's like they were going for European Courtyard and instead got Food Court At A Reasonably Nice Mall.My wine flight was good (I guess I chose well), but my husband's was not (I guess he didn't).It was a totally passable (if not far too pricey) evening, that I won't be hurrying back to repeat.

The staff is very helpful in recommending combinations and they don't make you feel out of place if you aren't a wine expert.

We did the cheese and wine pairing and it was delightful. They are only missing 5 stars because my customer service experience from the male bartender was not good. Everyone else was great though. Ill be back for sure.

Service was solid and the wine list was very deep. We ate upstairs in the balcony the space is small but quite enough during the lunch hour to carry on conversations.

The pork sirloin was so-so. What was that they put over the meat? Caramelized sweet radish? It just doesn't go well with the meat. Service was good and the atmosphere was lively.

The wine markup isnt so bad, but that should be expected at a wine bar. They have a great wine list and good options for tastings of wine and cheeses by the flight. The bar doesnt know how to make a martini, but once again they are a wine bar. If anything, I would say they should simplify the food menu. I found it to be too many choices, found myself spending too much time reviewing the menu, but I went there for wine and appetizers, not for dinner, so I may be biased."

The atmosphere is calm and soothing and let's talk about their meals! They're well done and absolutely delicious! Dessert was a bit dry but I generally loved the whole experience. The décor is poetic from the choice of color and accessories in the establishment. The special service offered for a romantic date is just on another level. I think it would be had for any person to turn down an engagement  or wedding proposal that is made in this establishment. More to the service and the décor, the accommodation facilities befit loyalty. Spending a night at the establishment is an epic experience. I would definitely come back for a second date at this place and recommend it to my friends with a lot of confidence."

We came on a Tuesday night around 7pm, and they were already packed! We ended up waiting about 15 minutes for some seats at the bar. The ambiance is great -- dim lighting that worked seamlessly with the high ceilings & impressive floor-to-ceiling wine tower. The wait staff was extremely friendly, and made great food recommendations! We tried:- the Riesling -- sweet and fruity!- baked brie -- no need to elaborate, just get it.- seafood stew -- recommended by our waiter, and it was so good! Will definitely be back if I'm ever in town again, but perhaps with a reservation next time."

The service was friendly and the staff very attentive. We REALLY Really enjoyed our meal here. Probably one of the best corned beef hash I've had. The corned beef was tender, flavorful; potatoes perfectly fried; delicious rye bread and two fried eggs on top. My friend had the fried egg sandwich (provolone, bacon, egg, greens) which he thought was great. We had a vegan with us as well and the server said the chefs are really good at accommodating food requests. They made the Espanola vegan by replacing the eggs with more veggies and avocados. Everyone was satisfied. Great service as well. Facility was clean including the bathrooms. I can confidently recommend Purple Cafe to others!"

I wanted to take her somewhere nice and make it memorable for her. She's a wine and cheese lover so I knew she'd appreciate this place but I also wanted to take her here so she could try something new as she doesn't have a very adventurous palate.First off, the ambiance was nice and romantic. She loved the tower of wine and spiral staircase in the middle of the restaurant. We started off upstairs in the lounge with a drink while we waited for our table and then headed to our table where we chose from the Tasting Bar menu.She was feeling a little adventurous so we had the the Duck Liver Pate and the Ahi Tuna Poke which were both spectacular. For our entrees, the lady chose Duck Confit and I had Filet Mignon. She LOVED the Duck and couldn't stop raving about it.After the numerous bottles of wine and all the delicious food, I'd say we had a pretty sexy evening."

Naturally, we got the look one gets when asking for exciting pinot and a ""Well, pinots are usually more mellow than exciting,"" yes we said, exciting but mellow will be fine.That interaction managed us the sommelier who came, chatted, and quickly returned with a few fist fulls of bottles and glasses and our dinner for 5 turned into a wine tasting for 5. We all learned something, and chose a bottle, which was great. We dared not ask its cost though we had asked for ""value."" A few ""tasting"" rounds of apps, some salads, and some great entrees, I had the pork, done nicely, and the to die for deserts..... we picked up another bottle. The check arrived and our new favorite was only $30, very nice Purple, very nice.But what blows me away about this place is the size of the space. It has got to be one of the biggest, openest venues in seattle with the giant wine rack spiraling up the middle. I think you just feel really good here, you feel out and alive as you look at the downtown buildings though the two story windows. Just go already....."

The roasted red pepper & goat cheese one is something I have cravings for from time to time, and the apple, walnut & stilton salad is great, too (it comes with a light, sweet, interesting champagne vinaigrette).Mondays are half-price bottle night. Recently, I was here with two friends and we shared a cheese flight to start, then we each had an entree and dessert, plus we shared a great bottle of pinot noir. It worked out to $33 each, including tip. You can't beat that!Their sorbets are always creative, fresh and delicious, and I love their sea salt caramels (you can now get an order of sea salt caramels to go, by the way! They make a great hostess gift).I love the decor here, too. Service is a tad slow, but knowledgable and friendly. When my husband and I went to lunch here as a little celebration on the day we picked up our marriage certificate, they brought us out champagne and sea salt caramels--on the house!We go here five or six times a year, and every single experience has been great!"

He should be replaced.The ramen was not good at all. The amount was small. I ordered extra noodles but I received it on a plate. I dumped the extra noodles in the bowl. There wasn't enough broth. The noodles were overcooked. The water was disgustingly lukewarm. None of the waiters knew who had what...I never recommend restaurants where waiters ask who had what. It's your job as a waiter to deliver the food from the kitchen to the proper person. That's the core task of being a waiter. Get it right. Four waiters came out with our food. It wasn't even timed properly. All four waiters asked 'who had what'.It was simply annoying.We were a party of eight and paid 18% gratuity for this poor service.

Lately, I've consistently waited an astonishing 20-30 minutes (no exaggeration) for the check. They rarely check on you for additional drink orders or refill your water, and there's often a frustrating 5-minute wait at the host stand before anyone greets or seats you. While I understand staffing shortages, it appears that there are just as many employees as before, but their coordination has seriously deteriorated.

The interior was innovative, spacious with great lighting. One of the best Ramen in Downtown. The service was fantastic, thoughtful, prompt, and knowledgeable.Amazing ramen that will serve traditional and low sodium. Got their light sodium option for most ramen except veggies and miso. The portion was just right enough to fill you comfortably. The appetizers were great. I can't wait to come back and try more."

Ramen. From the reviews this place gets busy. Walked in a greeted warmly by the service staff. My server recommended Pork Gyoza (which I could get anywhere) but what the heck. It was pretty perfectly cooked, crisp and carmelized on one side and soft on the other. The dipping sauce was tangy with a bite of spice. Could be maybe the best Pork Gyoza I can remember having. Sooo good I ate all 5 pieces in about 3 minutes!!! That must be record time! No shame here...and I sipped on the dipping sauce. I am sure not the only one who does that?!?! For my ramen I had the Yuzu Shio. I will be honest with you I'm a Tongkatsu black garlic kind of a girl. But I think I have changed my way. The Yuzu Shio was simple, flavorful and hit the spot. Pork was so tender and perfectly balanced by the french sea salt. I would be all wrong it I didn't mention the soft boiled egg. You know you're giving 5 STARS when most of runny YOKE ends up on your upper lip as you slurp up the brothly goodness. Kizuki thanks for doing it right!!."

I'd been craving ramen all day, and it was everything I hoped for. I ordered the garlic tonkotsu ramen, which was savory, garlicy (of course), and had delicious, we'll-balanced flavors. The egg was soft-boiled to perfection too. My girlfriend ordered the vegetarian ramen, which was delicious and flavorful as well. Hers was packed with tasty, well-cooked veggies.

We each had a different ramen and came away so happily satisfied. I love Japanese food but have never really wanted to eat ramen. We were there in January 2016 and it was cold and snowing. Ramen sounded so good and so we drove over there. It's near my niece's college (Seattle University). Parking was a bit difficult but I found a little pay parking lot through the GPS and it was a few dollars and was in a safe area. Lots of students and office types at the restaurant. The food came out quickly. My daughter couldn't get over the delicious half cooked egg that came with her ramen. She had never tasted anything so delicious and she always talks about it. Not only was her egg delicious but the soup was wonderful too. We would highly recommend this place.

And unlikely other most fast food/ fine dining places they don't rush you out of the door ! Great atmosphere and awesome decoration . My favorite ramen at kukai is Garlic tonkotsu low sodium and even thou I choose to get a lighter broth it's still very rich and flavorful. Professional staff with great attitude .

My friends' and my culinary journey encompassed an array of classic dishes, including Spaghetti bolognese, Mushroom & White Truffle Oil pasta, Carbonara with Campanelle, and Braised Beef Ragu. Unfortunately, the Carbonara with Campanelle failed to meet the lofty expectations, as it lacked the richness that I had anticipated. However, it was the Mushroom & White Truffle Oil pasta that stole the show, surpassing my expectations with its fragrance and flavor. While the unique sausage in the dish showcased the restaurant's creativity, it didn't align with my personal preferences. Lastly, the Braised Beef Ragu' emerged as a satisfactory choice but it wasn't mind-blowing Considering the price and the hype surrounding Due Cucina, my overall experience left me moderately enthusiastic in spite of the nice staff and the warm ambiance."

The casual atmosphere of the restaurant that serves great, healthy, inexpensive Italian food left us full and happy. My favourite dish from the restaurant was the pasta with oxtail ragu, and the spaghetti with tomato sauce. Having less carbs in their pasta also meant that I didn't leave the restaurant feeling bloated, I am still feeling full now after a few hours instead of feeling hungry again, which usually happens with normal pasta. There were 8 of us and we ordered a few dishes to share, the bill came up to just over $80."

Healthy pasta (made with 9 different grains as explained by the chef), a herb wall (hello urban farming), house-cured or artisanal meats and sauces made from scratch. The food itself is fresh and honest! The pastas have a rich, nutty flavour and a great texture and the sauces are bold, flavourful and tastes like.... real food! I ordered the basil pesto (the best I ever had) and my friends got the artisanal sausage with broccoli and Amatriciana. We couldn't pick a favourite. I never thought healthy food could taste so good!

Definitely not a one hit wonder. The vibe is super easy going and chill. Their craft cocktails are truly craft as they make their own fermented brews. This makes their margaritas impossible to beat. From oysters on the half shell to Fried Chicken or Nachos, there is something here for everyone AND they are totally Dog Friendly!!"

Stolen recipes, restaurant, and ownership. This restaurant was not brought up by these guys. I, was a loyal customer with the real owners. I wouldn't trust my credit card information under these crooks. They fail to follow health code procedures. Food isn't stored properly, even watching the video on their site: mojitoseattle.com/Mojito… you see the ""sous chef"" handled raw meat before touching ready to eat food that will be served to consumers. Unless you want to leave with food poisoning, or salmonella poisoning i recommend staying clear of this restaurant."

Unfortunately our one try at dinner last year was awful.We started with mojitos. Blech. A couple pieces of mint, some sugar water, and crappy rum do not a good mojito make.I don't remember the exact dinner items we ordered but each of our meals came with three or four items. Between the total of six or seven foods, the only edible one between us was the tostones.To top off the bad food and drinks, this place was pricey, annoyingly loud, and offered horrendous service. While we were two of only six diners the staff seemingly forgot about us and we went without water refills or the chance to ask for sauces or anything else that might have improved the meal.Mojito was a terribly disappointing experience and it's doubtful we'll ever give this another try."

I like to support small local businesses, but I think you could benefit from a few improvements!Pros:-Owner is very nice and friendly-Vaca Frita had the best flavor and was well balanced-Colorful decorCons:-The dining area was cold and drafty -The music was a bit loud for lunch-The menus could use a wipe down (the cleaner everything in the dining room the cleaner the kitchen should be)We had the:-Mojito Platter: yucca frita, tostones, and maduros (needed more seasoning)I liked the maduros the best because they naturally have more flavor. -Vaca Frita: best dish for balanced flavors-Lechon Asado: bland and sides did not seem fresh or hot from the kitchen-Cuban Sandwich: great! would get againRecommendations to future diners: ask for the sauces on the side if you do not like raw garlic (it is super healthy for you, but has a strong taste)Mojito I will try you again!"

I've had this place bookmarked for months and at long last I was able to sit down and savor the flavor of the Caribbean! I was surprised how small it was! I mean, they have over 400 (mostly rave) reviews and maybe nine tables! That means that they have a steady stream of hip and satisfied customers. I had the roasted pollo (that's Spanish for ""chicken""). I have to say that while I found it very flavorful, it was a little dry. Good thing they had so many really tasty things to pair it with. The first bite of their black beans and a little carnival started inside my mouth. The flavor was so deep and complex! I also liked the rice. Nice and simple. And I can never find anything wrong with fried things. I was afraid of the yucca, but like I say, fry it and I'll like it! I especially enjoyed the fried plantains! The creamy sauce with which they top it is out of this world!One more word on the service: Great!"

The server was very nice, friendly, and funny. He gave us appetizers and added meat on our salad on the house because our colleague is returning to her home country. I am not writing a good review because of the food on the house; it made this special occasion even more special. And, the food was delicious! We had Mojito Platter, Arepa, Ensalad Palmito with steak, Veca Frita, Pescado Mojito, and Pescado en Guiso. The steak had wonderful citrus flavor. The meat in arepa was also very flavorful, and the ""bread"" part was so good. I particularly liked Pescado Mojito--white wine and cinnamon may sound unusual, but you just have to try it. The desserts (on the house, too!) weren't overly sweet, which was nice. Thank you, Server, for making our last lunch together unforgettable."

I have driven by this place tons of times and never had the chance to stop until the other day. SOOOOO Glad we did. The food here is craveable and such a nice change from the standard fare in Seattle. If you are looking for authentic Cuban food you need to make the trip to mojitos. We had the Caribbean Salad, Cuban Sandwich and another pork dish. The caipirinha's were pretty delicious as well and the have crushed ice :)"

I don't know if it's authentic, all I knows and cares about is that it's slammin' good! I've had the Bistec A Caballo and the Vaca Frita so far and they do make a mean mojito. It is a small little weirdly shaped place, but that's part of it's charm in my opinion."

I returned to this place after a few years with high hopes but I couldn't even finish the food after a few bites. It was way too doughy and the sauce was tasteless. It's as if the ownership changed. It did not taste anything like I remembered.It's sad to see such a great restaurant has gone down but I will no longer return to this place.

After reading all the hype about it decided to try and didn't have a good experience. The cashier that took my order went to vegetable station to add my side order of mushrooms and used his bare hands to put it in the bowl and take it to the kitchen. I couldn't believe it. If they are so unsanitary in front of customers I can only imagine what's going on in that kitchen. My order was steamed chicken with noodles. Mushy noodles with bone in chicken not tasty. Won't be back!

She is so rude to her customers. Instead of taking feedback and taking the proper response, she completely humiliates her own customers. This speaks volumes about how she runs her business. Buyer beware!Anyways, my review (I can't wait for her response): I'm from Brazil on vacation. After this experience, I had to create a Yelp account today. I decided to try various places yesterday. I'm a great fan of Chinese food. I was visiting a friend at UW and I decided to try this restaurant due to the Yelp reviews. Worst.Mistake.Ever. Do not eat here. The cashier is rude and the ""servers"" are even ruder. I agree with others: the food is too salty. When I ordered the Tingly Beef, it smelled...like smelled rotten. I think that's why they salt it so much - to hide the fact it's rotten. I had one bite and I spit it out. I think I know why they call it ""Tingly beef""...it makes your stomach tingly with pain. Terrible....so terrible!!! I truly don't understand how they have so many 5 star reviews. ""They must be fake"" - I put this in quotes because the owner always thinks any negative reviews are fake. Anyways, enjoy at your own risk!"

I don't understand why the government would let this restaurant open given such a bad design. awful service: everyone is busy and we have to order first. The waitress does not have the time to care about you.Please raise your bar on taste. If you have tried Xi'an authentic noodles, there is no way that this could be compared. I normally would not do Yelp BUT this restaurant is very disappointing. Please think before go!!"

Your noodles need improvement you need to face the problem not begging for good comment or warning the customers The owner said she would report my comment to Yelp no matter what u do. You and your restaurant suck

The spicy oil dumpling is sub-par. The filling is bland and the gravy/ soup is very salty. The spicy lamb cumin noodles is less than average. Shredded lamb makes their presence very insignificant and the meat has near to zero fragrance and taste. The noodles and sauce is of average and has zero spicy taste. Overall, a pretty disappointed meal."

The food is delicious, but it is very oily and spicy, and having tea would help wash it down and balance out the flavors more.Parking is not too bad since it's pretty up north from the campus. The service was okay."

We went here during a Seattle Washington rainstorm, my friend said it was a good spot. I like noodles and like to try different noodle joints when I am traveling so I went to Xi'an Noodles. Got the Pho vegetarian broth and they put the carrots, sprouts, cucumbers, jalapenos and cilantro on the side and also onions. The tastes of this Xi's different options for Asian foods, wow!!! love it, go here :). The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I was nervous walking to the restaurant, there were a few suspect characters hanging out outside"

This is probably my 4th time visiting this restaurant since it opened. I love the food so much. If you're looking for a great Chinese food with endless noodles, this is the place. There's an option to make your own noodle soup. Otherwise, you can choose from there Myriad of dishes. my favorite is the tingly beef and sauce as well as soup. Also if you need to add some veggies to your diet or are vegetarian, definitely get the garlic cucumber salad."

The food is phenomenal for lack of better terms. From the hand pulled noodles to the broth, the flavor and spice blend is just right. The texture of the noodles is firm and stays firm throughout the meal instead of loosing it's hold and disintegrating into the broth. The broth has a very bold flavor profile and yet not too oilly as you would expect with Chinese cooking. I've personally always gone for the noodles with soup but either choice never fails. Xi'an noodles are hard to explain, it's a perfect soup dish when you want noodles but you're not feeling pho or ramen."

They didn't have garlic bread but a loaf with quality similar to Safeway with a homemade pesto butter that barely had any flavor. I ordered the penny vodka and I honestly could've made better.

I met up with a friend on Monday here and it's super cute. Easy to find and there's ample parking in the back (even though it's street parking / something I despise)! I ordered a mocha and it was awesome, one of the better ones I've had in awhile. I also got a almond poppyseed muffin, the girl behind the counter told me she had just put them in the case, so they were fresh. I wasn't a fan of the muffin, it was really dense. That being said, I am still interested in trying some of the other pastries they have and trying other drinks. Weirdly, after I parked my car and started walking to the Cafe, I swear I saw my dads car....and then I realized MY DAD WORKS NEXT DOOR. I felt like a shitty daughter. Maybe I can redeem myself for stopping in to see him from time to time before my stops in and out of Cafe?"

The Lemon Drop I ordered before my meal was made to perfection with fresh squeezed lemon; and I consider myself something of a Lemon Drop connoisseure :)  Most recently, I ordered the Gnocchi con Salsiccia e Funghi with portobello mushrooms added. The Gnocchi was perfectly cooked, which as some of you may know is difficult to do, and the dish was absolutely delightful, a masterpiece of complementary flavors and textures.The first time I came, the restaurant was close to empty and the atmosphere was relaxed and pleasant. The courses were spaced out and my friend and I had time to enjoy our conversation and take in the overall experience. The next time, my boyfriend and and I came for New Years Eve and although it was packed and hectic, the staff did an excellent job paying attention to the costumers and balancing the aesthetic of slow-paced European style dining with the fast-paced demands of the New Years crowd. And boy were some people demanding :) The table next to us seemed quite rushed and rude, even when they were brought a Tiramisu for the woman's birthday. Hey, I had to pay for mine! Not that I minded; I would have gladly pay double for that fluffy morsel. Alas, such is the nature of a busy restaurant. Overall, I could not be more pleased by the experiences this restaurant has afforded me and I will certainly be back very soon. Buono Appetito!"

First time had to wait about 40 minutes even though I had reservations for my anniversary dinner (made me feel a fool). This time was terrible for different reasons - many of them...First, got seated next to their huge booth, which somehow echoes and amplifies all the noise coming from it. Multiply that by wine-drunk women sitting there.Second, the food was no good. Got bread and the olive oil/vinegar dish. The bread we got was soo tiny that it was a joke. My date commented that they must have accidentally put a crouton instead. Asked for a larger bread and got it. I get that this is artisan-type bread. Their oil-vinegar presentation was terrible. They used some little deep dish that had vinegar on the bottom with a deep layer of oil on top. Problem is that there is no way to get both on the bread, so basically we were sopping up oil with the croutons.Their salumi plate was even bad - served on a gross cracked and discolored cutting board that should be tossed in the trash. Don't know why but the eats all seemed like they were dipped in oil.The ravioli fell apart. The two sides didn't stick together.Epic fail."

The service was okay, but not great. There was not wait as we went early on a week night.I hear that the menu changes a lot, and it must have been a good day for us as the food was great, but it was pretty expensive given the economic conditions.It's like Italian tapas, so we did as suggested by the server, and ordered six dishes for four people: Olives, panini, sea scallops, baked polenta, angolotti and spaghetti with wild boar bolognese. And wine. It cost $300.The portions are pretty sparse for the prices. I think $14 for four little scallops is exorbitant. They were good, but not worth the price. Ditto on the panini (it's a GRILLED SANDWICH) or the polenta, which were $9 and $13, respectively. I loved the spaghetti, though, and there was actually enough for all of us. For me, it's really a value thing. I'm still searching for that elusive Seattle restaurant that has top-notch food for reasonable prices."

The service & atmosphere didn't disappoint. They were still vibrantly busy at 9pm mid-week, and our server had great knowledge about the menu items & their preparation. Their service was warm & welcoming, and the bathrooms were spotless. The only reason I didn't give them 5/5 was because I was actually quite disappointed with the menu - it was tiny, consisting primarily of small plates & pasta. In addition, they were out of one of the pastas, so it was even more limited. The Bucatini pasta, while tasty, had so little sauce that it was barely discernible. All in all we will be back next time, but maybe just for late drinks & a small snack."

My favorites are the scallop crudo and the baby octopus, they had a perfect texture and a smokey flavor. As for a main course just go for the pasta, or whatever else sounds good on their menu because the menu is not very big; but everything on it has a big flavor. The only downside is that it can get very busy and when it gets busy it gets extremely loud, like you will have to shout at your boyfriend in his ear to be heard loud."

The place is tiny, but the atmosphere is still good. We sat at the bar and got great, friendly service all night. The menu was a little intimidating. Even though I consider myself pretty experienced in the kitchen, I didn't recognize half the things on there! They don't have a huge selection either, which was actually a breath of fresh air from the usual novels you see at chain restaurants. You know they must change their menu often and the things on there must be chef favorites. Their servers were really great about answering our questions and giving us suggestions, too.Like some other posters have said, the portions are small and the prices are a little high, but I think the experience outweighs that. I suggest getting some wine (recommendations from the bartender are always helpful), a couple appetizers and a couple entrees and just sharing everything. You might not leave stuffed, but I think you will leave satisfied. My favorite thing from the night was the honey potato gnocchi. Cooked perfectly with just the right amount of sweetness! I do not recommend the chocolate gelato, however. Maybe venture elsewhere for dessert :)"

My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary at this beautiful spot on Monday and I honestly am so bummed that I haven't been here sooner! As soon as we arrived through the front door we were greeted with an amazing energy from the staff. So many hellos and smiles to accompany the grace this restaurant has, was just the beginning of our experience. Our hostess was the epitome of perfect! Her eye contact and welcoming demeanor was such a breath of fresh air. She took the time to say congratulations for our celebration that evening, offered us a better suited table of we wanted, and explained everything to which we could understand. Thank You! As i sat across from the small intimate table from my husband, I observed every patron thoroughly enjoying their experience. Laughter could be heard, clinking of glasses echoed off the walls and the sunlight bouncing off the decor, was a picture perfect beginning to our night. Our waiter was fantastic! He really took his time with us! He explained the options we chose to start our night out with, and provided us with champagne that was pre ordered for our celebration. His authenticity and fabulous aura, was such a nice welcoming feeling. Now, the preparations of the menu items.... I swear, I have never tasted anything to heavenly in my entire life, minus my husband's home cooked meals (since he is the executive chef at Grappa and brother to the owner) every ounce of thought placed within the flavors were matched to Perfection! Every last bite I had was a mouthwatering as the first.. I couldn't get enough!!! I am so beyond thrilled to recommend this amazing gem to everyone and anyonen that is looking for a nice night out or just to be taken care of with grace and great attitudes! To those that worked this past Monday, I salute you to my and my husband's experience, making it one we will never forget. Till next time, Cheers!"

I adore the interior- I felt like I was in a ships hull all be it the nicest ship and the most modern hull. The wine list was LOVELY. I worked in wine in NY for a few years and although most of my knowledge has drifted out of my brain I certainly am snob enough to know a good Italian lineup. This is where my review gets boring. I loved all of it- from the wine to the food- the food was thoughtful and elegant. The staff was available, considerate of our needs and knowledgeable.  And they were playing PRINCE.  It might have been a little loud but it was still awesome. We danced in our seats. And we had a diverse crew- a wee 24 to a wise 55 and everything else between. I have no idea why this nugget of gold doesn't have a fiver on this site."

My party was placed on the waitlist, but after waiting for quite some time, we noticed that tables around us were being called and seated, yet we never heard our name.We approached the waitress, Wenjie, who was managing the waitlist. Wenjie insisted that she had called our table, but her voice was so quiet that no one in our party, nor those around us, could hear her. Instead of acknowledging this possibility or offering any sort of compromise, she doubled down and insisted she had done everything correctly. Her lack of flexibility and unwillingness to apologize made the situation even more frustrating.While the food may be good, the experience was overshadowed by this poor service. It's unfortunate that a lack of communication and unprofessional attitude from staff can ruin what could have been an enjoyable meal. I hope management addresses this issue to avoid upsetting more customers in the future."

Haidilao is well known for the service, but to be honest, we didn't receive any. There were two to three groups of people ahead of us yesterday at lunchtime, and we lined up for over 10 minutes without anyone greeting us. No one was there. I don't know how long the previous group waited, but we all left. My friends and I were HANGRY. We finally turned to upstairs DinTaiFung. DinTaiFung had two hosts serving us, and we got seated right away. Does Haidilao open the store for self-check-in? I don't know how the well-known service is, but it was a terrible experience for me. We will never be back to waste more time...... and money."

How did they get the 5star reviews??? I didn't write many reviews especially with low stars but for this one, I must give it one star at most.

It seems busy, but we don't get any essential service. When we arrived at the store, there was no greeting person at the front. We have to walk in and ask for the table. Then the host brought us to the front again, and we had to step out to check our reservation. We are here for the noodle show, but the show is perfunctory. The sauce bar was dirty, and some ingredients were gone without refill. Not worth it to pay extra for a limited choice. The price is high and the flavor is just okay. Overall the service is lacking and missing.You can easily find a lower price with better service hot pot restaurants in Seattle."

I've heard stories and hype about this brand from Asia that don't compare to what's available in the States. Soup was decent with some ingredients. Everything looked fresh with a bar of sauces. The portions are too small for the price. You can only see a show by ordering noodles.Overall clean, but knocking off stars for the price for the portions and constant interruption about their change of staff as we eat."

From the moment we walked in, we were welcomed with friendly smiles and seated right away. The atmosphere was modern, clean, and inviting, setting the perfect tone for a fun and interactive dining experience.We opted for a spicy Sichuan broth and a tomato broth, and both were absolutely delicious. The spicy broth had just the right amount of heat without being overwhelming, while the tomato broth was rich, flavorful, and slightly sweet--perfect for balancing out the spice.The ingredients were fresh and high-quality. We enjoyed a variety of thinly sliced meats, seafood, and vegetables, all of which cooked quickly and absorbed the flavors of the broth beautifully. My daughter especially loved the hand-pulled noodles, which were prepared tableside with an impressive and fun performance.Another highlight was the dipping sauce bar, where we got to mix our own sauces to complement the hotpot. There were plenty of ingredients to choose from, and we had fun experimenting with different combinations.The service was outstanding. The staff was incredibly attentive, refilling our broths, clearing plates, and making sure we had everything we needed. They even provided aprons to keep us clean and warm towels for added comfort.Haidilao Hotpot was a memorable experience for both of us, and we're already planning our next visit. If you're looking for a fun, flavorful, and interactive dining experience in Seattle, I can't recommend this place enough!"

The Angus beef for $1.99 and the Lamb shoulder for $2.99 were such good deals for the quality of meat you get. It's perfectly paired with their classic spicy broth.I always order the vegetable platter, mushrooms platter, and tofu platter to mix things up. And the fish roe lucky bag is a must-order for me every single time. The explosion of flavors inside that tofu bag filled with fish roe is delicious.The restaurant is very huge with some window seats that offer a view of Seattle downtown street. The highlight here is their sauce bar. With lots of options for appetizers, fruits, snacks, and desserts, there's something for everyone. And it's nice of them to provide instructions for each sauce style--it's a thoughtful touch.But I had some disappointing experiences. I have visited twice during non-busy hours, around 1-4pm, and the service can be a bit lacking. There were times when I couldn't find a server for 40 minutes, which was disappointing. However, my recent dinner visit was a different story--the service was prompt and attentive.Overall, Haidilao is a great spot for delicious hot pot. Based on my experience, I suggest going during dinner time for a better experience."

They showed me how to order and explained somethings. My waiter was very nice and made sure everything was okay. I came by myself so I just ordered the kobe beef belly combo. It was enough to satisfy me where I didn't feel gross, so personally for me the amount of food was good. I got 3 different soups my favorite was the pork bone broth (I think that's what it was called, the milky white color one). The traditional spicy was also good, pretty numbing. Lastly I ordered a mango green tea and that was also delicious. It tasted basically as the name suggests, mango with a hint of green tea flavor."

The food was delicious and beautifully presented. However, the service, particularly from the host during check-in, was not only rude and inattentive but also condescending and unfriendly. He seemed more interested in chatting with coworkers than acknowledging our presence, setting a negative tone for our visit. To make matters worse, my sister's experience mirrored mine. My sister joined our group later. When she asked the host for assistance in locating our table, his response was dismissive and unhelpful. Unfortunately, this unexpected behavior overshadowed the otherwise appealing food and ambiance, leading to a disappointing overall experience.Due to the unfavorable experience with the host, we were seriously considering seeking another dining establishment. Based on our overall experience, despite the good food, I would rate our visit to Kin Len Thai Night Bites as 1 out of 5. Moreover, considering the plethora of dining options available, it's unlikely that we will return to Kin Len Thai Night Bites in the future."

The customer service was by far the worst I have ever experienced. The receptionist consistently ignored us and even went so far as to call us liars, which is completely unacceptable.When we arrived, I didn't have my full party with me, so I asked if I could join the waitlist. The receptionist gave me an iPad to fill out our information, and the text message indicated that the wait time would be approximately 20 minutes. So when my friends arrived and waited for ~10 minutes, she decided to retrieve her jacket from the car. As soon as she left, a party of 6 walked in, and the receptionist immediately gave them a table. When I reminded him that we were still waiting, he first completely ignored me and walked away. Then when he returned, he rolled his eyes and accused us of lying about the number of people in our party, even though we clearly had four people.This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, and it is not the kind of service that customers should be subjected to. I am extremely disappointed in the way we were treated, and I hope that the restaurant takes steps to ensure that this kind of behavior does not happen again."

I understand it was busy but it was a Tuesday night and the place should've been staffed accordingly -Our food portions were extremely small compared to online pictures with a lot of stuff missing, this is not super bad but still disappointing. When we asked for refill on our soup for our 20$ hot pot they said they couldn't give any which was really interesting given the tiny portion size.- We asked for ice and never got it, I had to walk up to the bar to ask for it.- They spilled our food all over one of us and didn't apologize or offer anything to make it up to us. - They forced us to tip right in front of them due to their paying system: which is extremely rude because we felt as if we didn't want to tip but she was staring at us tip so we felt pressured. The server was a girl wearing low cut black v shirt with thick eyeliner & kinda chubby named Praew?(it said this name on the receipt) and this was one of the worst customer service experience I've ever experienced. Please do not come here for good food or good service. Go a few blocks down for better Thai food and actual servers."

Firstly, we arrived excited for a relaxed evening, but the service left much to be desired. At the beginning, our server was extremely slow to take our order. We waited far too long to even get our drinks, which was frustrating. To make matters worse, when the end of our meal came around, it felt like the staff was rushing us out the door. The server brought the check without asking if we needed anything else, and hovered around, making us feel very unwelcome. She must've come to our table no less than 10 times in 10 minutes. Additionally, I was particularly disappointed to find that there were no vegetarian options on the happy hour menu. In this day and age, it's surprising that a restaurant wouldn't cater to a variety of dietary preferences, especially during a popular time like happy hour.Overall, the combination of poor service and lack of menu options really soured what should have been an enjoyable evening. I hope they make some changes to improve the dining experience."

While I enjoyed some of the dishes, others left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. The standout dish was the glass noodle in clay pot - it was very flavorful and the shrimp was cooked to perfection. The dish had a nice blend of spices that made it a pleasure to eat.However, the fried chicken with red curry was a bit of a letdown. Although the chicken was cooked well, I found the red curry to be too sweet for my taste. It lacked the spicy kick that I usually associate with Thai cuisine, and as a result, it didn't live up to my expectations.On the service front, everything was fine. The staff were courteous and attentive, and the food was served promptly. Overall, my experience at Kin Lin was average. While there were some highlights, there were also some letdowns. If you're in the area and looking for a Thai meal, it's worth considering, but don't expect anything too extraordinary"

We tried the papaya salad, larb, and red curry with chicken, and all the dishes were top-notch. The flavors were vibrant and authentic, with the perfect balance of spices that made each bite a treat. The red curry, in particular, was rich and creamy, with tender chicken that soaked up all the flavors beautifully while still remaining quite crispy. The interior of the restaurant is stylish and fun, making it a great place to hang out, especially during happy hour. The deals are great, and the vibe really adds to the overall experience. Happy hour is definitely a must if you're visiting!The only downside is that there can be a bit of a wait, and they require the whole party to be present before seating, which can be a little inconvenient if you're with a group. However, the wait is worth it once you're inside.Overall, Kin Len Thai Night Bites is definitely worth a visit for the food and atmosphere. Just be prepared to wait if you're coming during peak hours. We'll definitely be back!"

We ordered the Crispy Chicken Red Curry, Eggplant and tofu, papaya salad, corn salad, pineapple fried rice, banana blossoms and a vegetarian curry. They were able to make some.of the dishes vegan which was great! Everything was very good but wouldn they the corn salad again. It really didn't have any flavor other than corn (which I LOVE corn) but for some reason it just didn't do it for any of us. Would highly recommend checking this place out. It was great to get a few dishes and share to get to try a bit of everything."

I definitely like coming to Some Random Bar. Everyone is friendly and it's a good mix of different sorts of people. It has a few TVs, but not enough to make it feel like a sports bar, but you can still catch the game if that's what you're in to. The beer is good and so is the happy hour. It's a nice place if you're looking for something that's not too trendy, but also not too boring."

The people who work here/run this place are fantastic. The beer list is on point, and the cocktail I had was delicious. Thanks SRB! We will make this a regular stop when in Seattle. On a side note, after reading a few of the reviews on here, I have a quick comment:@ Ken M. - For real? You gave a bar 3 stars because of Monday Night Football? If you show up to a bar, and it's ""not what you were looking for"", you leave and don't write a review. There are bars in either direction that don't have TVs. It's just bad form to say the drinks and service were awesome and then leave a 3-star rating."

The food was delicious but what really impressed me was the service. Our server Brian was just the right amount of attentive.  He made great suggestions when asked, kept our drinks topped off, and was super considerate -- even asking us how we wanted our bill split rather than just bringing it out. He even wrote in the tip box on each person's receipt that 18% gratuity had already been included. I felt compelled to add additional tip anyways!To top it off, I accidentally left my credit card there. I returned later in the day and they checked my ID and returned the card.

Great local beer selection and they are always adding fresh ones. They don't have a million tap handles and I like that, makes you try something new. On that note they do cover the beer spectrum with the selection, so something for everyone. Staff rocks, the waitress totally gave me permission to be as creepy and awesome as I wanted. Couple TVs, some tunes, and tasty food. Haven't had the wings but if they are half as amazing as the guacamole then bring extra socks because your feet will get cold when they are blown straight off. (guacamole is so effing good) Love this place, just moved to Seattle and this will be my go-to for a long time."

The bartender running the place was extremely kind in letting us order a cocktail and a tallboy each on the happy hour price (half price off all booze basically!) We also split a plate of sweet potato fries which were adequate. When it came for the bill, they split the fries onto all of our bills so we all paid the same. It was a really cool little detail that I appreciated a lot. It's a very thoughtful spot, great for conversations with your friends. Could do without the flatscreen tvs, but I get it. Will return!"

We experienced poor service during both visits to Pink Salt. Food was good but not great. Drinks were excellent. Maybe it just takes time for the owners to get into the swing of things - but we likely won't go back for dining - maybe a glass of wine but that's about it. Disappointing.  I agree with one of the other reviewers - if you're going to charge as much as you do, you really have to deliver."

There are not a lot of restaurant options in Magnolia that are worth going our of your way for, but Pink Salt is the exception. The food was delicious. Highly recommend getting the Yuca Rellana to start. The Pesto Rissotto with Tenderloin was also delicious. I only had a glass of wine but they had some tasty looking cocktails on the menu that are probably worth a try. The food was on the pricier side but it was cooked to perfection. We made reservations but were surprised that the restaurant was largely unoccupied on a Saturday night. It was nice that the restaurant was quiet but it was hard to get a sense for what the ambiance was intended to be. Great choice for delicious food and a nice dinner out though!"

To top off the meal, the brown sugar milk boba was the perfect balance of sweetness and richness.What truly elevated the experience was the outstanding service.

This place is a total hidden gem! From the moment we walked in, we felt right at home thanks to the super friendly staff and the cozy, inviting vibe of the restaurant. It's got that perfect mix of chill and stylish that makes it great for any occasion.Now, let's talk about the food. Almanqal absolutely nails it. Every dish we tried was packed with flavor, and you can tell they use fresh, high-quality ingredients. The grilled meats were perfectly cooked, and the Schwarma platter? So good. The hummus was some of the creamiest and tastiest I've had--definitely worth the trip alone. My favorite thing on the menu is the Lamb Kabob, which comes with your choice of appetizer. ( I recommend the baba ghanoush)The service was top-notch, too. The staff were attentive but not over the top, always checking in without making us feel rushed. They were also super helpful when we had questions about the menu.Overall, Almanqal is the kind of place where you feel like you're getting a truly special experience. Whether you're a fan of Mediterranean food or just looking for something new, you've gotta give this place a try. You won't be disappointed!"

In a nutshell, this place is extraordinary. After trying lamb, beef, and chicken dishes all around town, I can confidently say that Almanqal is in a league of its own. The flavors are simply incredible, and the meats are exceptionally tender. If you're a fan of lamb, beef, or chicken, you absolutely must pay them a visit.Their lentil soup is a warm hug in a bowl, and the Lamb Shank is a culinary masterpiece that practically melts in your mouth.Almanqal is now my go-to spot for forever.

We were excited to go to this place as it had been on our list to try for over a year. We were so disappointed since we only find ourselves in Seattle 1-2x a year! I'm upset that no one ever called me to say the restaurant was closing early that day, very unprofessional. We sat outside the restaurant scrambling to find another restaurant to go to."

While the food was decent, the service was far from acceptable. The sushi chef, who had visible tattoos, gave us incredibly rude service. His bad attitude and unkind words completely ruined what should have been a fun dinner. It's a shame because the quality of the food couldn't make up for the unpleasant interaction. I won't be returning."
Sugo Hand Roll Bar,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/sugo-hand-roll-bar-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Emma N.,1.0,11/17/2022,1,WA,"Before I go in on why I am giving one star, I do want to say the food is great! A little overpriced. So I wouldn't go here with a complete empty stomach. My favorite was the spicy tuna and Hawaiian poke. I also liked the Lychee martini they had. The miso soup was amazingly paired with the tempura shrimp as well.The reason why I'm giving a terrible review is because the service was so bad. I read some reviews on here about the service and it's BAD! I read a review here that their manager yells at their employees while trying to be nice to the customers. I also saw reviews on here that the hostess flirts with the sushi chef? Completely unprofessional. Well anyways, my server was this girl with the weird neck tattoos. I forgot her name. She seemed so annoyed serving us and just seemed straight up rude. We would constantly have to ask for refills on the water and she seemed annoyed that we were ordering more rolls. It's like do you want us to eat here or not? She seems like she doesn't want to be there and that we were an inconvenience. And hearing the workers talk about their personal life so loud from the back is annoying. Who wants to hear about their drama when you're trying to have a nice meal?Overall, this place is alright. Food is amazing but it comes with terrible service. Management needs fixing because why are you as an adult yelling at your employees like they're 5? Talk to them and manage them like they're adults and maybe they'll listen. Definitely need new servers too who want to be there and who is there to work, not to play gossip girl. Sad to say I love the food but hate the people."

The entrance was oddly decorated and staff were scattered, leaving their belongings on chairs in the dining area. Our table was located in a separate room, which was an unusual setup. The sushi was alright, but nothing stood out as particularly special, and with the high prices, I was left feeling underwhelmed and still hungry. While the restaurant itself was visually appealing and the staff seemed kind, they also came across as shy. With the underwhelming food and high price tag, I don't think I'll be coming back to Sugo Sushi."
Sugo Hand Roll Bar,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/sugo-hand-roll-bar-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Dan Y.,2.0,2/20/2023,2,NJ,"Disappointed by my visit. Sugo checks all the boxes for a hand roll restaurant- bar seating, a quick-paced dining experience, and somewhat pricey, bite-sized offerings- but doesn't execute well.I ordered the set of 5 hand rolls for $33. This includes chef's selections of scallop, spicy tuna, snow crab, and eel, and lobster ( a substitute for salmon which they were out of).I was expecting to pay a premium for food that prioritized quality of ingredients over quality. Maybe Sugo does use fresh ingredients, but it was impossible to tell as much of the sashimi was served grounded up and mixed with Japanese mayo to the point where it was difficult to differentiate one roll from the next. This confusion wasn't helped by the lack of explanation of what was being served. It was towards the end of service so perhaps our chef was more interested in wrapping up our meal. The experience felt rushed and frenetic on the whole. More on the service- the restaurant automatically charges a 19% and boasts a minimum $23/hr wage. I'm all for this on principle, but the quality of our service was subpar. The staff came across as confused and somewhat unaccommodating. For example, when we were told they were out of salmon, we were told that the only possible substitution would be lobster without reasonable explanation as to why we couldn't substitute something of equal or lesser value. In another instance, another staff member came by to offer to refill my full glass of water while ignoring my friend with an empty glass. Just odd things here and there that dampened the overall visit.  I was visiting from out of town, but I'm confident you can find sushi of equal quality for far better value elsewhere."

The service was...strange. We had waitlist inconsistencies which is understandable. But in the meantime the seating waitress yelled an expletive, for which she did apologize. The strange part came after at the actual hand roll bar, where we were told as part of the set we ordered there wasn't King Salmon, oh wait there was King Salmon, and of course there wasn't King Salmon. She said we had to replace it with lobster, which we asked if we could pick a different roll (of lesser value) and the waitress declined without any real reasoning (along the lines of ""it's our choice when we replace it"" and ""for the value"", honestly didn't understand). Water refilling was awkward too. It was just strange. Then on to the food:- spicy tuna: very spicy, oddly very spicy - scallop: was spicy without any indication of it being so on the menu- snow crab: very mayo- lobster: very very mayo - eel: probably the best, nothing to write home about They all lacked an appropriate amount of rice to balance the flavors, so I was left with very salty, overly flavored taste and no real raw fish... which, echoing the service, strange for a ""sushi"" experienceHonestly probably wouldn't recommend given the price and the other sushi available in the area. But glad I tried!"

We're usually pretty laid-back, but we couldn't help noticing how off the mark the servers were, a sharp contrast to the sushi chef's warmth. Little things like not emailing receipts or grumbling about being swamped left a sour taste. We get that restaurant life is tough, but basic courtesy should be a given, right?"

They also have tamari (gluten free soy sauce), which I greatly appreciate the thought behind it because I have a gluten allergy. We have been coming here for over a year at least once a month because the service, ambiance, and food is just unbeatable. During our most recent visit we had Joseph as our server and he was amazing!

Now for the flavor I can't express how great the quality of the fish is and how well balanced the flavors from savory to sweet with just the right amount of spice while some rolls have caviar as an addition which is a very pleasant touch.

Great to find a new local place where I can get great sushi roles. I suggest the spicy tuna. It was super fresh with a perfect level of spice for me. Everything we had was overall good.

Sugo Hand Roll Bar,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/sugo-hand-roll-bar-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=80,Jacob G.,5.0,3/5/2022,3,CA,"There is a trifecta that I look for when it comes to quality of restaurants and Sugo hits on all three!! QUALITY- I haven't enjoyed fish in such as way until I started eating here! AMBIENCE- talk about authenticity!! I went to Japan before the pandemic and this resembles a lot of what I saw there. SERVICE- this restaurant is not only memorable for the food, but the people. Staff was so kind and made me feel super welcomed. Thanks everyone for a super positive experience, will definitely be back when I visit Seattle again!"

I came with my wife and got the spicy tuna and california rolls - both were quite good. Our server was very attentive and helpful.I had never had a sake cocktail before but as a big fan of sake I had to try it. Not at all disappointed and will be getting one every time I go back :)The atmosphere was quite nice - I enjoyed the attention to detail in the interior design.We will be coming back!

It's a modern vibe with amazing food. The Norichos and the Blue Fin Tuna Sashimi is to die for. IT WAS FIRE!! The service we received was solid and we will definitely be back again. They made us feel welcomed and gave us an amazing experience.

I loveeee sushi and did not know what to expect just stumbling across this place while showing a out of town friend what Pike Place has to offer. So happy we found it! It was just their second day of a soft opening so they didn't have their full menu yet but what they had was AMAZING. I'm honestly considering going back tonight, that good. A lot of the basics you see but also some really unique items (truffle avocado roll? Yes please. Wagyu with uni and caviar? Sign me up). My sushi server was not just making us delicious rolls but entertaining us with great conversation throughout the meal. Apparently there is a second side of the restaurant that will open for summer time, can't wait to see what they do there! If I could give 6 stars I would - So good!"
Sugo Hand Roll Bar,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/sugo-hand-roll-bar-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=90,Nate W.,5.0,2/21/2022,4,WA,"Got to try Sugo for their soft opening on Saturday night, servers were very friendly and attentive. I tried the 4 set along with a crispy shrimp roll and wagyu roll. Overall the quality of the fish/food was top notch. Found the clam miso a touch salty; the wagyu roll with uni/caviar was amazing! Will definitely be back soon."
Sugo Hand Roll Bar,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/sugo-hand-roll-bar-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=90,Alexis B.,5.0,2/19/2022,5,CA,So yummy! Tried Sugo for their soft opening and their food is already some of the best I've had in Seattle. The waiters and waitresses are really committed to providing great service and are really friendly. I really liked the modern atmosphere and how different their food was than any I've had before. A must try if you're in the Seattle area!
Windy City Pie,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/windy-city-pie-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Karyl H.,1.0,11/9/2021,4,WA,The service and the pizza were the absolute worst. Never eating here again.
Windy City Pie,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/windy-city-pie-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Patrick N.,1.0,8/21/2021,23,WA,"Was so excited to try Windy City and I'm extremely disappointed. We took our ""Carnivore"" home and it was so wet that I was able to fold the slice in half, vertically. The dough was like a wet sponge and it really appeared that the pizza was parbaked earlier in the day or even the day before. There was no marrying of the cheese and the sauce, and fully intact low-cost Hormel-esque pepperoni, further lending to evidence of pre-baking. Zero crunch, zero crisp. The dough was also way too sweet. This is not Chicago Style Pizza. So truly disappointed and I won't be going back. UPDATE: The owners of this establishment cannot handle any criticism of their sub-par pizza and resort to sophomoric replies that wave like a flag of unprofessional defensiveness. Their response of keeping our pizza flat, which we did, would have nothing to do with the pizza being wet, underbaked, and pre-made. Please don't waste your money here, there are far better pizza places and other local businesses that are actually deserving of your business."
Windy City Pie,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/windy-city-pie-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Rachel K.,1.0,6/12/2019,10,WA,"Absolutely horrific place. The owner is batshit insane. Terrible pizza, terrible service and verbally abusive owner. Waiting until this place gets shut down."
Windy City Pie,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/windy-city-pie-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Timothy C.,1.0,1/20/2017,151,OH,This place is expensive and the service is not up to my standards.
Windy City Pie,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/windy-city-pie-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,John P.,2.0,2/5/2024,1,CA,"1st, for reference, see the photo of the menu presented when ordering online - There is no clear indication between Chicago Deep Dish (not labeled) and thin cracker crust other than a tiny banner over some that says ""Tavern-Style"", and a stand-alone pizza called ""Tavern Style Thin Pizza"" with red sauce and mozzarella. We can't be the only ones to have made this mistake, and hopefully WCP figures out how to handle it better and fix their on-line system...We ordered what we thought were 2 Chicago-style deep dish pizzas online with dine in for two people and had to prepay everything including the tip. We get there early, they confirm our reservation and sit us, and the wait person confirms our order for 2 thin cracker crust pizzas. We let them know that we were expecting deep dish but their response was to first show us the menu and our mistake, and that we could order and pay for a 3rd deep dish pizza. 3 pizzas for 2 people :/ and we were already in for $80.  We expressed our frustration very clearly, even including the words, ""It's fine"", which anyone in customer service should know means, ""This customer is really dissatisfied and frustrated"" and we need to make it better, including getting management involved. The thin crust pizzas came and at some point we were asked how was everything, to which we laid out our frustration very clearly. The waitstaff could only defend themselves and didn't offer any resolution, only excuses. They did offer to get the manager but at that point we had enough. We never saw that waitperson again or a manager, but someone did show up and made me pay for my $8 beer before we left."
Windy City Pie,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/windy-city-pie-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Jordan S.,3.0,8/20/2017,4,WA,Not quite Chicago pizza but pretty darn good
Windy City Pie,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/windy-city-pie-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,James W.,4.0,8/2/2023,8,WA,"Maybe the best deep dish Pizza I've had in Seattle. I wish they put on a little more protein on their Pizzas, but other than that really great."
Windy City Pie,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/windy-city-pie-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Stephen F.,4.0,6/22/2022,15,WA,"Wasn't really sure what to expect since I haven't had a Chi style pizza since I was a kid. This was a delicious, dense pie. The crusty edge was awesome and the spicy peppers inside really kicked off the flavor. One pie was enough for 4 adults, just as the website says!"
Windy City Pie,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/windy-city-pie-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Evan H.,4.0,6/12/2021,4,WA,"i  went to here on the week before and was seriously blown away at how delicious  everything was, and so my girl and I wanted to check . Everything is fun and  cooked to perfection!! The flavors are popping, the cilantro sauce is maybe  one of the most amazing things that's ever hit my taste buds."

Windy City Pie,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/windy-city-pie-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Isabelle G.,4.0,6/15/2017,5,WA,"The pizza is pretty solid and you can eat it there in the Batch Bar, next door at Holy Mountain, or take it to go. Since it's thick Chicago style, make sure you plan for about 30 minutes for it to be prepped."

And this review is overdue, but still SO necessary to share. When we were planning our wedding, we knew we wanted great food, and didn't want to use typical catering. We thought of Windy City Pie and contacted Dave who helped us make it a reality. Serving 100 guests, we offered three pies (omnivore, Brussels snout, and 4 pepper) along with the beets by Schrute salad, on each table for a sit-down dinner. Dave and his team went above and beyond to provide us with amazing looking pizzas that tasted delicious. From planning to delivery and dinner, everything was amazing."

You know it is a pizza pie when they tell you to keep it level so all of the goodness doesn't spill out . Next time I am in Seattle I will be hitting this place up .

Windy City Pie,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/windy-city-pie-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Ron L.,5.0,8/12/2019,2,IL,"I was on a trip from Chicago and I wanted to try a pizza like Pequod's Pizza so my wife and I went to Windy City Pie. WOW! It was better than Chicago's Pequod's Pizza. Pizza has been a big part of my life. I've tried every type of pizza in Chicago over the years and there is always room for more great pizza. This is a new great one.We order online. That made getting our pizza easy when we got to Phinney. Cool space. Love the eclectic environment. Neat bar and drinks. Check out the artwork. But it's the food and the friendly staff that make this place great. It is the food that is the star of this evening. We had the Meatza. The crust was crisp especially the carmelized cheese edge. It may look burnt to those who don't understand what they are getting but don't overlook that delicious part of the pizza. The sauce is a perfectly tangy and sweet combination. The homemade sausage was delicious. The bacon and pepperoni are equally balanced with the other ingredients. The cheese works as a great counterpoint to the sauce and the other in tasty fresh parts of this masterpiece. This pizza is an indulgence that is worth the calories and carbs. Go for it. If you're worried about your diet they have other great options. My wife had the All Kale Caesar! salad. She loved the freshness, the switch of kale for the romaine lettuce and taste overall with a smaller serving of pizza which left more for me. This place is busy, order online, but be patient. They have games you can play while you wait or just watch the campy movie on the screen. Enjoy your night at this unique place."

I have, on several occasions, purchased numerous pies to share with friends as I feel it is an experience that must be passed along to as many people as I can. A pizza missionary, if I may.Out of the people I have shared a pie with, I have a 100% conversion rate, spanning over dozens of friends and coworkers who in turn shared this glorious, cheesy wonder with the people they know.Keep up the awesome work, Windy City Pie."

What makes this pizza different is mostly how delicious it is, but the pizza maker working his ass off with the kind of quality you can't find elsewhere... That's what tasting the fruits of a person's American dream is like. Don't believe me? Try this stuff, LIFECHANGING. Keep kicking ass Dave, you're amazing!"
