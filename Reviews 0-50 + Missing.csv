Quite cozy but, a fun atmosphere and a bit loud. Quite a few small twists on BBQ dishes without going too far out of the box. The cornbread in particular was outrageously good! The cocktails were creative and excellent? They were a great selection and text... even for a power drinker. The service was great and suited our tempo. We'll be back."
Radiator Whiskey,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/radiator-whiskey-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Chloe H.,4.0,4/17/2024,3,WA,The whiskeys were unbelievable.

Radiator Whiskey,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/radiator-whiskey-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Angela B.,4.0,10/17/2023,125,CA,"Radiator Whiskey, located on the 2nd floor above Pike Place Market and accessed through an elevator, offers a hearty dining experience that earns it a solid 4/5 rating. Despite the crowded seating and full bar area, the ambiance is lively, bordering on loud, making it a bit challenging to hold a conversation. The portions here are generous, catering to those with hearty appetites or groups looking to share.The loaded tater tots is a great, easily shareable appetizer for 3-4 people. The toppings were generous especially the pulled pork. The smoked then fried chicken dish, accompanied by a substantial serving of Mac n cheese, and cornbread, comes with two sizable pieces of chicken and is perfect for those with larger appetites or can be shared by two, especially if paired with an appetizer or side dish.The fried pork shank, while tender, lacked balance. The collared greens were overly salty, highlighting the need for some form of carbs, like bread or potatoes, to counterbalance the dish's fattiness and saltiness. I see in the pictures that this was served with some form of pasta in the past, not sure what changed. We didn't try a drink here but will plan on doing so next time. Solid option for dining near downtown if you account for the noise level and lack of space."

The menu items are original and unlike anything I've seen elsewhere, but everything was super yummy and reminded me a little strange comfort food. I'd never purchase chicken livers, but the fried chicken livers with franks hot sauce were astounding. As was the tater tots with gravy and fried egg, as well as the pork cheek stew with Fritos. (The Fritos actually make the dish). Next time, I'm purchasing the pig face, not only because it seemed tasty, but the left overs came wrapped in a foil swan. Not only is the food great, the staff were wonderful as well as the atmosphere is cosy and laid back."

The food is good-- the drinks are amazing. The only thing that was kind of weird is that we had to stand at a stand up table and eat our lunch. Wasn't a huge fan of that. They should reconfigure their seating somehow.
Radiator Whiskey,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/radiator-whiskey-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Allie Y.,4.0,1/5/2016,535,CA,"My boyfriend and I came here for NYE dinner. We called earlier in the day and they told us that reservations were full and we could dine here if we walk in and wait. We really wanted to try this place out since my boyfriend loves whiskey and the food here looks yummy. Upon arrival, we were surprised that the restaurant was only 3/4 full and was seated promptly. It made me wonder how many customers they turned down on the phone if they told everyone who called that day that reservations were full. It was a difficult for us to find this place but it is located between the Pike Place sign and the Starbucks across the street. You take the elevator up a few floors and walk down hallway to get here. It felt like walking in an office building which I never experienced or imagined a bar to be at.Service: We were seated promptly at a table that fits 4. After another party of two left, the waitress asked if we would like to move to the other table for two next to the window with a view. I thought this was nice of them and the view outside our window was the busy 1st Ave and of course, the strip club across the street. Food: I ordered a Turkey Drum Confit and my boyfriend ordered Fried pork shank. The Turkey Drum confit was big and cooked very well and was not dry at all! The sauce that was served with it was super delicious as well as the potatoes it came with. It was the perfect portion. The fried pork shank was juicy and meaty. Ambiance: I liked the tiny barrels around the restaurant. With the dim lighting and individual candle lighted up on each table, it gives a very classy feel.Overall, I would definitely come back. The food, drinks, and service is outstanding."
Radiator Whiskey,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/radiator-whiskey-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Dave W.,4.0,8/22/2015,5,WA,"I really, really like this place.

You can get a tall boy of rainier and a shot of whiskey for $5 - gets the job done. They give you popcorn to snack on, too. They also, expectedly, have a great list of whiskey and cocktails too.

The food was good, the service was great, and the drinks? Excellent! You have to like beer, bourbon, or whiskey--they really know how to pour here. You have to appreciate real rock music. The music selection was spot-on and added to the laid-back vibe. Lastly, you have to be real. If you're expecting some high-end, pretentious dining experience, this isn't the place for you.If you're looking for a casual spot with good BBQ, great drinks, and an awesome playlist, this place is worth checking out."

We didn't eat, just had some whiskey and a glass of reisling. The service was awesome - super friendly and attentive. I'd totally recommend it for drinks. We didn't try the food since we already ate, but I heard it's good too. Not sure about parking, we walked from pier 55, took us about 10 mins. Oh, and don't miss it - the bar is upstairs and the sign isn't very obvious. But seriously, the service is top-notch! The vibe was really chill on a Wednesday night. If you're into whiskey, you should definitely check this place out."

On my visit, I opted for the smoked and fried chicken, complemented by mac and cheese. The experience was truly delightful. Although chicken isn't usually my go-to choice, this particular dish proved to be an excellent decision! We were served by Amanda, who was not only personable but also quite well-versed in her field."

Every dish has been the right portion, so we leave not feeling stuffed. The wait staff is great and always super hospitable."

In all fairness, their menu has a promising look. I think if we didn't order an appetizer, but I can come back for that. Service was fabulous! I'll probably try to go on a happy hour for more discounts."
Radiator Whiskey,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/radiator-whiskey-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Hanna B.,5.0,5/9/2019,6,NC,"Crowded bar setting with chic gourmet eats.The place was a little difficult to find, but well worth the search. We started with the watermelon tomato salad. This fresh and tasty dish was not a dish I was expecting to find this kind of bar scene, but it got me excited for the rest of the meal. For mains, I ordered the fried pork shank. I consider most things that are fried to be good, but this was excellent. The layers of texture below the crispy fried crust to the tender meat made this dish a delicious adventure to eat. Great place to wind down after tiring yourself out from site-seeing around Pike/Pine!"
Radiator Whiskey,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/radiator-whiskey-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Emily M.,5.0,12/3/2018,4,WA,Great location to start off . It has a great happy hour . Would recommend this place to people visiting the area

Perfect ambient and nice view from the corner edge bar seatings (by the entrance)!!! Perfect for a quick bite and snacks before the concert at showbox!

Atmosphere was fun and the place has a lot of interesting things to look at. This place feels like the ultimate man cave. Everything is rugged from the menu to the drinks to the decor. Its technically a bar with very limited food options.
Radiator Whiskey,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/radiator-whiskey-seattle?not_recommended_start=80,Vicky Z.,5.0,5/24/2018,10,IL,"The food and the atmosphere was great. I made reservations for a party of 4 two hours before opening and they were able to fit us in! The roasted half chicken was so delicious - it had a nice smoky flavor with a sweet glaze. The potato salad along with the shaved salad consisting of zucchini, yellow squash, and celery paired really nicely with the chicken. The picture doesn't do the dish justice - it was a generous portion but I managed to finish it all!"

Located upstairs on the 3rd floor it felt pretty hot & stuffy but we quickly got over that with some YUMMY drinks. Staff was extremely friendly and the open kitchen allowed us to watch the chef work his magic! Before you order take a look at their specials. We had the Debris Sandwich and the fried pork shank. Then topped it all off with the pecan pie with rum ice cream. We left stuffed!

We were looking for a laid back, chill environment and radiator whiskey is just the place. It was a bit crowded on a Friday night. Took us about half an hour to get a spot. My friends and I just wanted to chill and talk about life so we ordered a bunch of cocktails and drank it. Wasn't sure what it was but I believe it was probably tequila or vodka.After being there for a bit over an hour, we got hungry and ordered tater tots. It definitely hit the spot. It came wit a fried egg on the top and wow what a finishing touch.If you want to go here to drink, snack and eat light or full food. This is the perfect place with the perfect ambience. Could get extremely busy though."

Lots of creative interior, keeping with the Pike's Place vibe. Our table ordered a few different flights, all constructed tastefully, and we were pleased with the recommended fried eggs and tots. Our server, Rachel, was one of the best servers I've ever had and was happy to answer all of our questions. This spot is a gem, and I am planning on coming back soon to try their cocktails!"

Radiator Whiskey,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/radiator-whiskey-seattle?not_recommended_start=110,Robert E.,5.0,6/3/2015,1,WA,I am a huge BBQ snob and had found nothing that compared to what is produced out of my backyard until I went to Radiator Whiskey. The Porchetta was magical. It was smokey and porky and fatty and everything you want out of porchetta. Their fried chicken livers are amazing too. I don't know anything about whiskey but the Bourbon Margarita was very good. I have had friends who do like whiskey swoon at their selection. Find out about the Beast Feast. For a group of people you get a whole pig for $300. I'm looking forward to my gang going in a few weeks!

Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Jessica L.,1.0,10/11/2024,6,WA,"This dining experience for their tasting menu was a terrible disappointment. I can't exaggerate enough how unsatisfying and way too salty the dishes were. And the desserts were soaked in alcohol, like why? The owner and chefs there really need to taste the dishes they are serving. How can you serve something almost inedible and charge $700+ for two people. We have been to other tasting menus in Seattle and this is somewhere you should stay away. I would say the night went bad once we noticed it took 20+ minutes in between dishes. I've never experienced a tasting menu that took 3+ hours to finish. There was a foie gras pasta dish that should not be served to anyone for any reason.. it was really hard to chew and swallow. Mostly the dishes tasted like salt, sugar, and alcohol... This restaurant is inconsistent with their dishes: 1. We were celebrating a birthday and two others around us were also celebrating. Our birthday dish was the only one without a candle... odd. 2. My partner and I both did the non-alcoholic drink pairing and for some reason our drinks were not served the same level of liquid and ice.. a little weirdOverall I'm glad we got to experience this place and won't be recommending this place to anyone."
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Leon S.,1.0,6/11/2016,5,NV,Overpriced and under delivered. $600 for 2 and the experience was a joke. What a mistake.
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Max M.,2.0,6/15/2019,28,MA,Food and wine was meh . Way over priced for what it is. Was not impressed with any of the dishes
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Tanner K.,2.0,5/7/2018,5,WA,"Expect to pay 300 plus dollars to be held hostage for 3 hours before the tasting menu is complete, only to end the night with an upset stomach and violent diarrhea."
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Matthew K.,3.0,9/1/2023,6,WA,"For$300 per person, I would have expected more. Nothing about the decor, ambiance or staff attire screamed fine dining.The food wasn't anything to be wowed about."
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Andrew J.,3.0,6/14/2022,15,WA,"It was a good meal but overpriced. With food, tip, wine, e.t.c, you're spending more here than you would at Canlis or the Herbfarm, and the experience is not better or vastly different. A decent experience, definitely not to be repeated."
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Richard C.,3.0,3/22/2018,2,WA,"Thought this place was fairly good and worth a try, just a little over priced."
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Ronald E.,3.0,3/11/2018,90,CA,Me and my friends actually went to this place just to have drinks but then we realized that we should have some of their interesting pastas. We ordered their Papparedelle and it was pretty tasty and delightful. The spicy ragu was extremely mouthwatering and delightful and we definitely enjoyed it. I just hope that they could upgrade some of their drinks to make it more tasty and interesting.
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,George S.,4.0,10/19/2023,25,WA,"Been hearing about this place for a long time and finally was able to try it. Very cozy atmosphere, pretty cute decorations and great service.Although I heard about this place so many times before, I still don't know what I was walking into, and I have no idea about the food they serve.But since I love food I was willing to try, and I was excited. The course meal started with oysters and caviar, followed by sliced beef tounge, and then the noodle pasta with anchovy flakes, with sorbet as intermission. At this point I'm already a bit full, but the pork and wagyu beef makes it difficult to stop.Everything was very tasty and delicious. This is a pricey restaurant, but we definitely get our money's worth."

Never have I been to a restaurant for dinner for 2, and the receipt shows over $600 ($500 + tips)  Of course, half of that went to the wine bottle but still..."

Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Nhi H.,4.0,7/29/2021,69,WA,"Took a friend here for a birthday dinner and we did the 8:30pm time slot. The food was pretty good, the ambiance and atmosphere is very chic and very much similar to other fine dinning establishments. The food was pretty different. I still don't know how I feel about pigeons for main protein course. I was hoping for something more for the price. And the additional truffle shavings on the pasta was pretty lack luster. My only complaint is that the service is very slow. By the end we ran out of the restaurant because we were there till 11:55pm. I get that they wanted to serve everyone at the same time with all our courses simultaneously but some people are very slow and we had to wait for them. I was just exhausted by the end. Food was 8.5/10 service was about 6/10 over all I'll say everything was about 7.5/10."
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Stewart H.,4.0,12/24/2019,10,DC,"I don't attend fancy dinners, but decided to splurge once with another couple. Simply amazing! The food had layers of flavor that literally became the topic of conversation until the next dish. Drinks were endless and the atmosphere melted away as the focus was on food and company. Definitely considering making progressive dinners like this a regular thing."
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Mark W.,4.0,8/26/2018,10,WA,"Highly recommend this place! Food is delicious. It is modernized Italian food with a twist. What I love about the food is that the flavors are all very subtle yet they have a small kick of a unique ingredient. So if your not a fan of food with very strong flavors, or a not yet used to having powerful ingredients, this is a great place to start introducing your pallette to new and unique flavors(high end cuisine). Best part about the restaurant in my opinion is the open concept and how you can see how the chefs are preparing your food. It is very interesting and amusing to see how these types of meals are being prepared from start to finish. And how everyone in the kitchen seems to be creative with what they prepare. Overall had a great experience!"

My husband and I came here for our 5th anniversary and cannot wait to come back again. Yes, it's pricey, but worth every penny.

A new coworker brought me here last week. I didn't realize it had just opened, and I don't normally go to restaurants until they've been open for a month or two. I just like to let them iron out the kinks.Anyway, the food was too good to not mention. The rib-eye was cooked to perfection. The chicken was moist and tender-and was served with roasted grapes! Even the bread was divine.There is just ONE thing keeping me from giving Altura 5 stars-the room. It's just a bit ""clunky"" for lack of a better word. Our table was hard to get in and out of, and my elbow would hit the wall when cutting my food. I mentioned it to them, and they seemed appreciative. The service was also excellent!"
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Riley J.,5.0,9/15/2023,5,WA,First time back after four years of drought and it's just as fantastic as always. Love the new single seating format and the food is off the hook.
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Olivia N.,5.0,5/22/2023,9,WA,"This represents the pinnacle of dining experiences I've had in Seattle. The ambiance of the restaurant is a blend of energetic and tranquil. I had previewed the sample menu prior to my visit, yet each dish still left me in awe. The meticulous attention to detail was simply remarkable. Opting for counter seating provided us with an exclusive view of the chefs crafting each inventive, refined, and delightful dish. I couldn't have enjoyed it more!"
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Kevin L.,5.0,1/25/2023,129,WA,"I had an incredible dining experience at this restaurant! The produce was incredibly fresh and prepared immediately upon ordering, which really made a difference in the taste and quality of the dishes. The highlight of the meal for me was the red sponge cake - it was absolutely amazing and I couldn't stop raving about it to my friends afterwards. The restaurant also impressed me with its creative use of ingredients, such as the wagyu fat candles, which added an interesting and unique flavor to the dishes.In addition to the delicious food, the cooks were extremely friendly and made the dining experience even more enjoyable. I also highly recommend sitting at the kitchen counter, as you get to watch the chefs in action and even receive free samples of dishes. Overall, I want to thank the team at this restaurant for a truly great experience and can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious creations."
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,William A.,5.0,9/26/2022,5,SC,Truly incredible... highly recommend!
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Casey L.,5.0,3/5/2022,16,WA,Wonderful dining experience! We did the drinks pairing as well. I really liked that it was a mix of cocktails/wine and mocktails. Every course was well thought of. Altura is certainly on the expensive side but certainly worth a visit!
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Shu W.,5.0,6/6/2021,5,WA,Very good restaurant with impeccable reception. The staff are very pleasant and very kind. We appreciated the time taken by the waiter to explain the dishes we did not know.
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Justin C.,5.0,4/22/2021,4,CA,"Altura is a gem. Incredible attention to detail from start to finish. Bites are meticulously plated and seasoned perfectly with the addition of heat in appropriate proportions. In terms of service, Chef prepares everything as you roll in. I was fortunate enough to sit in front of chef's counter, where we watched everything prepared as we sat down. Meaning, the second I walked in, our dishes six courses down were being freshly assembled. Canapés breaming with color and visually appealing juxtaposition, all adorn in front seat with beautiful fresh greens like red vein sorrel. The dishes rolled out seamlessly as service flowed with the kitchen. Everyone around us felt at home as the food continued to pour in. From the first few bites we got to witness one said plate our food for the next course, while the other side prepared our dishes for the following. Almost in unspoken synchronicity everything streamed onto our view. My friend, who had never witnessed pasta being freshly prepared, stared in awe as Chef rolled fresh raviolo without hesitation. As the drinks poured, and the dishes were consumed, we ended the night with a phenomenal series of dessert bites with minor table side service to finish. To sum everything altogether, I must say, this restaurant exceeded my expectations of what Seattle's fine dining scene had to offer. I'm thrilled to see this restaurant standing still after the coils of pandemic had ruined our restaurant industries left and right. If anything, last night stood as a testament and will to the determination this team has to delivering what really good food is to our beautiful Emerald City."

Walked in shortly after opening and were seated without fuss or hesitation. Every bite created thoughtfully. Got the wagyu and didn't regret it. Appreciate the take home menu and truffles.
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,Jessica P.,5.0,3/30/2019,302,IL,"This restaurant isn't eligible for a Michelin star (or 3) as it's in the wrong city for that. But Altura is most certainly a contender for it when and if Michelin comes to Seattle. We sat at the counter tonight and had such an incredible experience! We sat by Bridget, who was working the sauté station. Also nearby was the head chef, Nathan Lockwood. So. Delicious. So unpretentious. Such depth to the flavors and such unusual combinations. Super fresh and seasonal ingredients, which were honored by their treatments. The crew works in an open kitchen with a calm and precision. It isn't stuffy, it isn't rigid but it is polished and clean. We're from chicago. We know good food. This isn't as fancy shmancy as Alinea, but it is just as delicious and honestly one of the best meals I've had. Thank you Altura!"

My husband and I came in late December to celebrate our birthdays. Word to the wise show up hangry (hungry to the point that you are angry about it)- we made the mistake of only being hungry and towards the end became too full to finish the desserts. As others have mentioned the menu is predetermined so all you have to do is sit back and enjoy the experience. This place deserves some kind of michelin star - Bravo!"
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,Jerry L.,5.0,12/30/2017,129,TX,This one of the best tasting menu restaurants I've ever eaten at anywhere. The wine pairing really add to the experience and the small seating capacity lends to an intimate dining experience. A pricey dinner but par excellence and well worth the cost!!
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,CC A.,5.0,12/27/2017,5,CA,"This place is divine. I highly recommend sitting at the bar so you can catch all the action from the chef that runs an amazing tight ship. Sitting at the bar also allows you to ask the chef/sous chefs about the food, the ingredients and gives you that perk that they make you something special specifically for you. I went when I was having dietary restrictions due to allergy and they prepared amazing, delectable dishes that didn't skip a beat despite my multiple restrictions. If you are looking for special, romantic, small, quaint place with orgasmic food, this is the place. If you want to impress a foodie, take him/her there."

Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,Woman R.,5.0,1/20/2017,2,WA,The chef has never disappointed me once.

Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,James A.,5.0,7/8/2016,15,PA,I was lucky enough to eat at the counter at Altura while on business in Seattle my last night. This place was recommended to me by a friend back in NYC and I am glad I checked it out!Although I was still jet lagged and quite a bit tipsy I had an excellent meal. The chefs tasting menu is an excellent value and holds up to any michelin star equivalent in other cities I have been too. It was nice to just chill out and watch the chefs behind the counter prepare all the different courses with such precision. Also the wine pairing was great with the sommelier tailoring it to my preference of no white wine. There were some unusual wines and it was a nice experience to enjoy so many in one night. I rarely yelp but had to about this place!
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Chad W.,5.0,4/20/2015,11,OR,"We ate at Altura last weekend and the food, service and atmosphere were all wonderful! There are lots of inventive choices for each course and lots of options for tasting menus with and without wines. We sat at the ""chef's table"" overlooking the kitchen area and it was fascinating. Even if you think you know how a restaurant kitchen might run, you can learn something here!Thanks, Nathan, for a fabulous meal start to finish!"

We got the five course dinner, and it was excellent. The homemade pasta was just great. The courses were small, so you try lots of different stuff. Be sure and get bread when you arrive, the dipping sauce is amazing. The only complaint: hard to get in, it's so busy! I guess that happens when your good is so good...."

Imaginative (venison ravioli with chocoate infused sauce!) and extremely well balanced taste and texture in every dish. Kudos to the chef. It was my husbands birthday, and it was most excellent. Especially loved the razor clams with semolina crust. Just outstanding. Tough to get a reservation, but worth doing so well in advance to have a special meal at this top notch seattle restaurant. Pricing was fair--$49 for three courses of your choice!Yummy."

Di Fiora,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/di-fiora-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Nhi H.,1.0,8/11/2021,69,WA,"This is review comes after numerous visits to this place that has lead me to update my previous review. Let's be clear that the food and cocktails here are great, the flavors and plating of various dishes are amazing. But I've seen the progression of decline in service that has lead to horrendous customer service. I don't think I've ever had a waiter tell me, ""it's been 10mins and you haven't order anything, and we over booked reservations tonight and need the table in 30mins""I am very disappointed in any establishment that will approve of anyone with such unprofessionalism and disrespectful attitude towards patrons. We had just sat down and the menu wasn't pulling up on our phones. I also don't find it pleasing to hear restaurants are over booking reservations and rushing people to eat. That's so unpleasant to hear from a restaurant that I've dinned at many times before. After this experience I think I'm going to stay away from here for a while or just get Togo, becuase dealing with their rude staff and workers has made this place very irritating to dine at."
Di Fiora,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/di-fiora-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Teresa G.,5.0,7/29/2021,5,WA,We loved the environment but the food was nothing special.

Disappointed we spent so much just to be sick:("
Di Fiora,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/di-fiora-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Michael G.,2.0,5/3/2022,3,WA,"Overpriced and overrated.We spent a Sunday in Seattle, and found ourselves later in the evening (is 9-10pm considered late now even in downtown Seattle?), and this place was still open (last call, must pick a dish in the next 5 10 minutes!).Smaller serving sizes and a taste that did not inspire. Surrounding tables with larger groups of friends were having fun with some cool looking cocktails, which may be a good enough reason to come here."

The vibe? Equal parts ""your rich friend's remodel"" and ""Instagrammer's paradise."" The food? Actually, shockingly good. The kind of Italian that makes you pause mid-bite to question every sad spaghetti night you've ever had.The staff? Friendly, but with that ""cooler-than-you"" Seattle edge--like, yeah, they know you're impressed, and they're totally fine with it. Prices? Let's just say your wallet might need a hug after, but honestly, worth it.In short: Di Fiona is annoyingly perfect, like Seattle itself. Pretentious, beautiful, and somehow irresistible. Damn it, I'll be back."

Di Fiora,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/di-fiora-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Yvonne C.,5.0,11/13/2024,5,WA,"Di Fiora consistently knocks it out of the park with every visit! First and foremost, the atmosphere is simply stunning. They refresh the décor with the seasons, ensuring it's always a feast for the eyes--truly an Instagram-worthy haven.Our culinary adventure included dishes like Kow Soi, crab fried rice, steak, garlic pork over rice, crispy garlic chicken, duck avocado curry, seafood tom yum soup, and Vietnamese crunchy rolls, all beautifully plated. While everything we tried was delicious, the standout stars were undoubtedly the duck avocado curry and the crispy garlic chicken. The curry was, without a doubt, the finest I've encountered in any Thai restaurant--rivaling even some of the best Peking duck I've tasted! Though no one asked about my preferred spice level, the flavor and heat were perfectly balanced, leading me to dip nearly everything in that luscious avocado curry.The crispy garlic chicken is always cooked to perfection, with a garlic dressing that's downright addictive. I find myself craving this spot at least once a month, and we'll continue to return for a consistently enjoyable meal that never disappoints. Di Fiora truly knows how to curry favor with its patrons!"
Di Fiora,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/di-fiora-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Kristi H.,5.0,8/20/2024,4,CA,The best neighborhood Asian Fusion restaurant. Must try the calamari and the Malaysian Coconut soup- with shrimp- to die for.Actually- everything is good here!

He not only seated us but also served as our server throughout the meal. While everyone who assisted us was very kind, our primary interaction was with him, and he truly excelled in his role.As for the food, I'm perplexed by any previous reviews describing it as ""bland."" Unless they mean it's not as intensely spicy as vindaloo curry or ghost pepper level, I'm not sure where that criticism is coming from. Speaking as someone who has an extensive spice cabinet and is often critical of under-seasoned dishes, I can confidently say this place was outstanding. My partner and I dined here last night, and we were both thoroughly impressed. We ordered the crispy duck with green curry, the house carbonara, the ahi appetizer, the coconut soup, coconut crepe cake, and a total of three cocktails. Every dish was excellent; we were particularly enamored with the coconut soup, which we wished we could buy by the gallon. The duck and carbonara were also exceptional, bursting with full flavor, and impeccably prepared. While the ahi appetizer wasn't quite on the same level as the rest of the meal, it was still quite good--my partner especially enjoyed it. Overall, the dining experience was stellar, and we're already planning our next visit before we have to leave town. We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town!"

We ordered the steak and crab fried rice, which both turned out to be very delicious. The steak had unique Asian spices that blend very well together with the meat and salad on the side. The fried rice was soft and tasty and I kept wanting more. We will definitely come back to try other dishes :)Note: they have a reservation system and are usually fully booked. We didn't make a reservation beforehand but managed to get in after waiting for half an hour. So make your reservation."

I love their wings because when you eat them with the sauce, it taste amazing, and when you eat them without the sauce they taste EVEN BETTER. Its almost like magic. I swear I am not even lying because without the sauce it taste so refreshing, and their is a hint of a lemon lime taste at the end. Its amazing. I love this place so much. My cousins and I went for the first time for a galantines event we were doing and we all were mind blown. Its cozy, cute, comfy, yummy, and the service and drinks were bomb as well.

The fried calamari and crab fried rice were especially enjoyable. We also tried the Malaysian Coconut Soup with seafood and the rainbow salad. Although I typically consume white woodear mushrooms in sweet soups, I appreciated the texture of the mushrooms in the soup here. Additionally, the rainbow salad would be visually appealing on Instagram. This restaurant is an ideal location for a romantic date or a night out with friends."

Crazy busy so I decided to come back again this Monday brunch ( with reservation) all the dishes that I ordered still delicious as before. Especially the crab fired rice which is my fav one. I love the Monday vibe with full house customer but not too crowded. The playlist was very interesting as well. Never disappointed every time I came here.

There is absolutely no system in place for the Togo orders. They are definitely unable to keep up with the demand of business. There is no social distancing happening when you pick up your order! None of the employees are wearing mask. This place is a covid trap waiting to happen. Do not order food here as they are not prepared for the demand or have a safe system In place. On top of that, the guy GARY who works the front table is not friendly at all and completely stressed and unprofessional. He is RUDE AF! Sorry fogon, officially going down the street for safe Mexican food! Absolutely no excuse for the horrible customer service from GARY. I would like an explanation from the owners as why they are putting customers at risk but not following CDC guidelines to wear a mask. It went to affect April 3rd! Also, during a pandemic when people should be really be nice to each other you have the worst person GARY at the front helping customers who has the worst attitude ever. I am coming out of my house to support you as a restaurant and I'm treated like that is completely unprofessional. It says a lot about a restaurant when you see all the reviews and there is absolutely no response from the owners. Good or bad."

This place tends to get very crowded and sometimes the lines get long. They do have a lot of seating so it turn around pretty quick. Most of the staff members are friendly but you can tell that it does get a little overcrowded at times and things get missed. It's a good place to go if you are getting ready to go out and get hammered or are coming back from getting hammered. I just wouldn't think of going here for regular dinner or a date. There are just too many options to eat in Seattle for better quality (except you will pay more).

If not enough the ambiance allows for a relaxed meal and great conversation."

Despite the hour and a half wait (when we were told 45m-1h) and loud ambience, the chips, salsa, guac, and food were delicious.Everyone in the group got the entree with meat, rice, and beans so we got to try different dishes. I had the pollo asado and was surprised to see a large slab of chicken on my plate. But I didn't even need a knife it was that tender. And don't even get me started on the handmade corn tortillas!

From lackluster dishes to poor service, it fell far below expectations.Firstly, the gumbo was bland, lacking in flavor, and the seafood was overcooked, resulting in a less-than-pleasant texture. The Mac and cheese, while a classic favorite, was ruined by an excessive amount of smoky flavor. Even the cosmopolitan tasted more like watered-down Kool-Aid than a crafted beverage.To add to the disappointment, the service was subpar. Our waitress seemed disinterested and unfriendly, displaying an attitude that made us feel as though we should be grateful just to be dining there. Her lack of helpfulness only exacerbated our already tarnished experience.Overall, Communion failed to deliver on both the culinary and service fronts. For those seeking a memorable dining experience in Seattle, I would advise looking elsewhere."
COMMUNION Restaurant and Bar,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/communion-restaurant-and-bar-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Boykin S.,1.0,4/28/2021,2,CA,I am definitely not at home here. Twice the hostess turned me away claiming the empty seats were for reservations only. I never expected such snobby behavior from a soul food joint. Evidently gentrification turned these Black folks bougy to where they turn away customers who aren't white hipsters living in the area. A decade ago East Union was a crime infested area with struggling Black owned businesses begging for customers. What a difference a decade makes. So I took my money to another business with much better customer service does not care about the social caste of the customer.

However, the food was average, service was fine, and branding/marketing is corny (e.g., calling their sushi Hood Sushi - why?!) Based on their social media pictures, I thought I was going to take one bite of a dish, slam my hand down utensil tightly gripped and let out an expletive in joy. But, no, I took one bite of the hood sushi and could not discern the flavors of the catfish or other ingredients. I primarily tasted seaweed and rice and the watermelon sauce just added salt (a lot of it) to the mix. Overall, the food didn't live up to the hype. Though, I may give the food one more chance because the catfish and grits LOOKED amazing (all their food looks delicious on Instagram and in-person). All the food I ate was just okay. First, I tried the sushi which didn't offer the fusion flavor the chef intended. The shrimp toast would have been great if it wasn't over toasted. Also, the greens were too oily for me."

While there were some highlights, there were also areas that could use improvement.Food Quality: Everything we ate seemed overcooked and dry. It seemed as if it was reheated too many times, idk but it wasn't what I was hoping for cause almost every review I saw made it seem like it was gonna be some of the best food in the PNW. The drinks were good though. The best part of the meal was the watermelon salad. The flavored hot sauce just tasted like regular hot sauce to me so that was kinda disappointing. I saw some Nigerian and Carribean-inspired items, so I tried the akara; they were a miss for me personally. Service: The service was friendly and attentive. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and offered suggestions. However, there was a bit of a delay in getting our food, which was a downside, especially when you're hungry. (But the delay in food wasn't an issue in totality because it was busy so that's expected)Ambiance: It has a laid-back and casual atmosphere, which fits the cuisine. The décor and music were enjoyable. It was kinda weird that they picked and chose who to enforce their dress code with and not. Portion Size: The portion sizes were quite generous it was enough for two of us and more. Drinks: The drinks were really good and fit the theme. The names were unique and some were already premade so all you had to do was pour and enjoy.Overall Experience: While my visit had its share of ups and downs, there were some notable aspects. The flavors and ambiance created a pleasant atmosphere, but the food quality was inconsistent, and the wait times were slightly longer than expected. I would recommend giving this restaurant a try, but I hope they focus on improving the consistency of their dishes to make it a more reliable dining option. It's a three-star experience for now, but with some tweaks, it could certainly reach higher heights."

We opted for the Chef's counter tasting menu and felt quite satiated by the fourth course. Not only were the staff engaging but the chefs and line cooks were equally interested in how we were doing, what dish stood out, etc. Not to mention the free beignets from Andrew, who was happy to share his newly mastered technique with us. The food was incredibly layered with wonderful ingredient selection, preparation and execution. The oysters with bacon were some of the best cooked oysters I ever had and don't sleep on the greens as presentation, they paired so well with sauce too. Highly recommend a visit if you like a dining experience to be engaging and each dish to be well designed and paired exquisitely with all ingredients. Next time, I'm opting for the wine pairing."

What brought me to the restaurant was the cool drink menu which was inspired by one of my favorite shows-The Wire. We were able to reserve a seat at the chefs counter and it was worth it. The chef and other kitchen staff were amazing. The interacted with us, answered with questions etc. The octopus is absolutely phenomenal and so was the pork chop and sablefish dish.

The food was absolutely delicious, especially the Steak Bites, Fries, and Crispy Brussels Sprouts. The menu offered a variety of options, and everything we tried was top-notch. The pub itself has a great atmosphere, with solid vibes that make it a nice spot to hang out.One of the highlights was the extensive drink options available. They had a wide selection of drinks to choose from, catering to various preferences. The service was quick and friendly, adding to the overall positive experience. The staff was attentive without being intrusive, making sure we had everything we needed.The prices were fair for the quality and quantity of food and drinks provided. It's always a relief when you get good value for your money. All in all, it was a great experience - good food, good drinks, good service, and good vibes.

re:public,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/re-public-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=20,Jessica R.,4.0,8/9/2014,4,WA,"Strolled in for brunch midday on a Saturday, not really knowing what to expect. I had previewed a brunch menu online that looked like it was on point, but I was really sold by the fact that they take online reservations for brunch - unheard of in Seattle - and all I really wanted was some good food in a decent atmosphere without the hours long wait that generally trademark brunch in this city.While this is certainly one of the many dinner/bar locations that brunch offerings are clearly their second line of business, with ""brunch"" written on a chalkboard for diners to take notice while they are in for a drink on a Friday night, I was pleasantly surprised at the airiness of the place with the roll-up opened on a nice summer day.Service was great - timely, thoughtful, and kind. Mimosas were generous in the champagne department and were mixed with fresh oj. And the food - THE FOOD! I ordered the beef short rib chilaquiles and the hubs ordered the fried chicken/waffle. The chilaquiles were delicious! Topped with radish and cilantro, a side of black brand with cotija cheese, and served with crème fraîche, a lime wedge, and green ""diablo salsa"" - just the right amount of heat. The fried chicken and waffle were also amazing - the chicken was juicy on the inside and had perfectly crispy skin, and the waffle was sprinkled with pecans and bacon and topped with a cardamon butter that was to die for! The perfect sweet/savory brunch item.If you're looking for a fabulous brunch without the wait, re:public is now definitely on the top of my list."

The red letters on the sign make it that much more magical. Anywho, we had a private company event here and I definitely indulged. The ambiance was very romantic so I could definitely see myself cruising here for a nice glass of vino on a weekend or weekday with a sweet lil' thang.I had the crab puffs as an appetizer and they were quite scrumptious, some amazing lasagna and pasta for my entree. After I was almost all the way full I tried their rib eye and was immediately blown away. This place wasn't too pricey so definitely worth your time if you're in the area.Bonus info: This is about 1 notch up from Joey's in SLU. It's more expensive so I would recommend Joey's if you're just having drinks and/or a light appetizer and Re:Public if you want a higher class menu and ambiance."

This has become a monthly treat for me and a couple co-workers. Fantastic wine list, amazing food, small portions but worth every penny. You just have to get a little wine-drunk first and savor each bite. I wish I had done a review when this was still on the menu, but I am going to mention it anyway...foie gras creme brulee. Yep, most amazing thing I have ever had in my entire life. I couldn't tell if I was eating a meal or a dessert, omg, if you guys are reading this please, please bring it back! I have only sat at the bar, but service is always attentive even when its busy. Until last week I was only in on weekday nights, but I stopped by for a martini by myself on a friday and it was packed! Definitely a fun scene on the weekends if you are looking to meet people or come in with a group, probably not as good for a date seeing as it was super loud, but good for them for being busy. A+"

Usually have a great experience. Whoever was the hostess tonight made me never want to return. I walk in at 10:25 to be seated and am told their kitchen closes at 10:30. Which is odd cause I've never been told this especially cause I only order oysters and a few drink around this time and day. Needless to say I won't be back.
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,emily c.,1.0,10/11/2023,1,WA,"I am still reeling from shock of how horribly myself and my family were treated. I, visibly pregnant, was seated at a table with a bench on one side and 2 chairs on the other. My 2yo and 5yo were both sitting with me on the bench side waiting for my husband to arrive. There were 3 other similar tables next to us, all still unseated. The hostess kindly brought us crayons for my children to color on the paper laid across the table. My daughter was coloring, never straying once from our table. My son was guardian of the crayons. On three occasions, my *near 2yo* screamed loudly ""MINE!"" when my daughter went for a crayon. I am well aware this is less than ideal. It is a phase he is in, screeching any time he is excited or mad or expressing emotions. Before and after each of those moments, he was calm and happy and just fine. Each time he did it, I did my best to get him to stop immediately. We had been there all but 10 minutes. The manager, Christopher Fischbach, approached me and said ""You are going to have to reign this in."" I asked ""excuse me?"" And he said ""you are going to have to reign this in. We can't have your children running around and the screaming will have to stop."" I replied that my daughter hadn't left the table once and then asked how he suggest I stop my not yet 2yo son from screaming?"" He said he didn't know. I asked ""and what if I can't? Will we be escorted out?"" And he said ""if it is excessive, maybe so. We have to seat these other tables.""At this point I was so incredulous, I could not believe this was being said to a paying customer, let alone the fact that a child was being targeted. I asked if this was routine for them, he did not reply and he walked away. I still cannot believe this happened. I am appalled. I am ashamed to say that we stayed, but I refuse to be bullied. Yeah, they got my money, but I have my dignity. And I hope Christopher (who, no, does not have children of his own) treats families trying their absolute best with the respect they deserve moving forward. He was a pretty massive disappointment to humanity tonight.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money here. The food was not remotely worth what they lack entirely in service."

As you've probably gathered, my partner is a transgender woman and I fully support/love her, we were eating at the Old Spaghetti Factory in Southcenter when my partner said she felt someone staring at her, I was going to assure her that kno one was staring, however, I was appalled to see this kid working there standing in the kitchen entrance pointing at her, I stared the kid down until he walked away. I immediately asked for the manager, the manager who came over to help us was completely drunk, he asked us if we were sure he was pointing at us, and he offered to pay for our food.

Way to offend patrons who want to support your restaurant. Your employees are mandated to obey the owners political views - no thanks. Never will we support your business. Service was terrible once we expressed being offended.

I have been to the pink door for many many years and for many occasions, however on this particular occasion we were celebrating 2 birthdays. We enjoyed a very nice lunch for two, linguine vongole and the squid ink pasta seafood special.The awkward moment arrived when the server brought us an empty plate with two birthday candles absent of anything except the two candles.We felt as though he presented an ""empty"" birthday wish. I am still dumbfounded by the gesture. Honestly I would have preferred no recognition rather than the empty plate presentation. That was the one star reception we received. My friend had flown in from San Francisco for this luncheon and it was immeasurably disappointing."

The problem was the cost of the food for the quantity and quality. We really went to see the perfomace thinking it would be a fun way to spend dinner. Well the performace is five minutes at best, every 30-45 minutes so don't go for that. The food was way over priced. I spent $44.00 for a small bowl of (premade) gluten free pasta with a bland cream sauce, a butterscotch pudding (which was pretty good) and a glass of water-yes $44!!! . Since I had to eat GF I didn't get bread unless I wanted to pay $3 more for Udi's bread. There were no dinner salads, veggies, meat for my dish or anything else. I hate the Italian Denny's (Olive Garden) but have to say I have had better meals there and for a better price. Felt a bit duped by the allure of a cool performace which is the only reason I was willing to spend that kind of money on pasta only to find out it the performance wasn't really part of the ambiance. Very disappointing."

The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=10,EmmLee W.,1.0,9/16/2013,8,WA,"We planned our meal two months in advance, reserved a table, and hoped to top off the last night of our Seattle vacation with an excellent view, meal and drinks.We were seated on the patio, jammed into a corner but jutting out into the walkway, where we were jostled by staff and other diners. We ordered sodas while taking a moment to look at the wine menu, and decided to share an order of the calamari with spinach. This was okay, a bit overcooked and chewy, but we had high hopes for the meal - I ordered linguine with clams, and my husband ordered clams and mussels.I had one bite of my pasta with clams, and couldn't eat anymore. The pasta was overcooked, but all of that was masked by the amount of sodium in the ""broth"" - you could taste nothing BUT salt, as though a cup of it had been poured into the cooking liquid. The acidity burned my tongue and scoured the inside of my mouth. I couldn't taste or eat properly for two days afterward. My husband's clams and mussels had no seasoning or taste, other than that of steamed and overcooked seafood. No garlic, wine, herbs or anything else. It was as if they'd steamed the shellfish and dumped them in the bowl. Also, no pasta or other sides were served with that dish: $26 or so for a bowl of flavorless steamed mussels and clams. We declined to order something else, and asked for our check. This was the only time in our lives that we've ever walked out of a restaurant. Although the manager comped our soda and calamari, we left a comparable amount on the table for the waitress and staff. We figured they shouldn't be left without the tip they'd have received had the chef and kitchen staff not put out such an embarassing ""meal"". We spent an hour trying to find another restaurant that was open in the area after 9 PM, which oddly enough is not easy to do, especially as we'd walked from our rental to The Pink Door.As far as ambience and staff: the greeter and our waitress were very nice. The place was okay, but other than some cute decoration and a good band, it wasn't exceptional - certainly not enough to balance out the mediocre starter and inedible meal. I can honestly say I'd not recommend this restaurant to anyone."

While the ambiance and drink selection were noteworthy, my overall impression was tainted by uncomfortable seating, lackluster food, and an unpleasant aftermath.Let's start with the positives. The restaurant's ambiance and wine selection create a cozy and sophisticated atmosphere, making it a suitable spot for drinks and socializing. However, when it comes to the dining experience, there are considerable drawbacks.The seating arrangement was notably uncomfortable, detracting from what could have been an enjoyable evening. The chairs lacked ergonomic design, making it difficult to relax and fully savor the dining experience.Turning to the food, I ordered the chicken, expecting a premium dish given the prices. Regrettably, the reality fell short of expectations. The chicken was disappointingly dry, reminiscent of a budget BBQ chicken one might find at a grocery store. The lack of succulence and flavor left me questioning the value for the cost.Unfortunately, my disappointment did not end with the underwhelming meal. The next day, I experienced persistent gas and an upset stomach. While I'm not quick to attribute these symptoms solely to the restaurant, it does raise concerns about the quality of ingredients or food handling practices.In light of my overall dissatisfaction and the subsequent digestive discomfort, I believe the establishment should consider refunding my purchase. A dining experience should leave patrons satisfied and comfortable, and unfortunately, Purple Café and Wine Bar fell short of these expectations."

The last two times I have been there in the last two months, the servers just seemed to be checked out and going through the motions. There is no passion in their work, and they are no longer trying to create an ambiance or a dining experience, and when I drop 2-300 for a dinner for 2, I expect more. I went there this evening, and again the waitress comes over with a nice bottle of wine, but where is the sommelier? Have they gotten rid of this program where the Som comes over and decants your wine. I loved talking about wine with the Som, and thought it added a nice touch. Guess Harvest Vine and Luc will now get my business. Goodbye Purple Cafe. My filet mignon was not medium, and even though I told my server, she didn't really seem to care, and I am not one to send food back unless she felt it should return to the kitchen, and she didn't say anything. The filet came by itself, so I found myself hungry afterwards and ordered two cheese tastings which were nice as always. There just isn't anything special about Purple any longer........it's just get the customer in, and get them out...............I can feel a better energy and have a special dining experience elsewhere. Seattle has some great restaurants. Sorry Purple........won't be back. GC"

This place had some of the rudest, most pretentious @$$holes I have ever met. So we went in late on a Tuesday night after a Mariners game, as my buddies sister and friend were in town from the East Coast. After ordering a shot and a drink, we were content for about 45 minutes. My buddy ordered a drink and about 20 minutes later hadn't received it. When he finally received his drink, I ordered another, and jokingly asked him if I could get it in less than a half hour. Turns out we didn't look like the crowd they prefer, so he decided that my joke meant I was intoxicated and didn't deserve to be served anymore. It was my 2nd drink in an hour, AND we had ordered food. After speaking with a manager, he agreed that I did not look intoxicated, but they don't undermine the ""judgement of their staff"". Maybe my joke was in poor taste, but I was trying to be lighthearted, not offensive, and if you work in a bar, you should be ready to deal with garbage from rude patrons, and a little banter at the bar shouldn't be handled like that. 0 stars is what they deserve,, and I guarantee I will never return to this place.

Enjoy a flight of wine and cheese pairing or something else before you order. I'm definitely not a wine buff and my wife is no expert, but we enjoy the ability to have a relaxing conversation and enjoy some new wines we normally wouldn't try. The staff is very helpful in recommending combinations and they don't make you feel out of place if you aren't a wine expert. The entrees have all been quite good and very reasonably priced, with the exception of the lobster mac' n cheese (although it is well worth the $27). My only complaint is how cold it sometimes feels. I would love to see a nice fireplace added to warm things up in the winter."

The wine markup isnt so bad, but that should be expected at a wine bar. They have a great wine list and good options for tastings of wine and cheeses by the flight. The bar doesnt know how to make a martini, but once again they are a wine bar. If anything, I would say they should simplify the food menu. I found it to be too many choices, found myself spending too much time reviewing the menu, but I went there for wine and appetizers, not for dinner, so I may be biased."

The atmosphere is calm and soothing and let's talk about their meals! They're well done and absolutely delicious! Dessert was a bit dry but I generally loved the whole experience. The décor is poetic from the choice of color and accessories in the establishment. The special service offered for a romantic date is just on another level. I think it would be had for any person to turn down an engagement  or wedding proposal that is made in this establishment. More to the service and the décor, the accommodation facilities befit loyalty. Spending a night at the establishment is an epic experience. I would definitely come back for a second date at this place and recommend it to my friends with a lot of confidence."

The ambiance is great -- dim lighting that worked seamlessly with the high ceilings & impressive floor-to-ceiling wine tower. The wait staff was extremely friendly, and made great food recommendations! We tried:- the Riesling -- sweet and fruity!- baked brie -- no need to elaborate, just get it.- seafood stew -- recommended by our waiter, and it was so good!

The service was friendly and the staff very attentive. We REALLY Really enjoyed our meal here. Probably one of the best corned beef hash I've had. The corned beef was tender, flavorful; potatoes perfectly fried; delicious rye bread and two fried eggs on top. My friend had the fried egg sandwich (provolone, bacon, egg, greens) which he thought was great. We had a vegan with us as well and the server said the chefs are really good at accommodating food requests. They made the Espanola vegan by replacing the eggs with more veggies and avocados. Everyone was satisfied. Great service as well. Facility was clean including the bathrooms. I can confidently recommend Purple Cafe to others!"

I wanted to take her somewhere nice and make it memorable for her. She's a wine and cheese lover so I knew she'd appreciate this place but I also wanted to take her here so she could try something new as she doesn't have a very adventurous palate.First off, the ambiance was nice and romantic. She loved the tower of wine and spiral staircase in the middle of the restaurant. We started off upstairs in the lounge with a drink while we waited for our table and then headed to our table where we chose from the Tasting Bar menu.She was feeling a little adventurous so we had the the Duck Liver Pate and the Ahi Tuna Poke which were both spectacular. For our entrees, the lady chose Duck Confit and I had Filet Mignon. She LOVED the Duck and couldn't stop raving about it.After the numerous bottles of wine and all the delicious food, I'd say we had a pretty sexy evening."

Naturally, we got the look one gets when asking for exciting pinot and a ""Well, pinots are usually more mellow than exciting,"" yes we said, exciting but mellow will be fine.That interaction managed us the sommelier who came, chatted, and quickly returned with a few fist fulls of bottles and glasses and our dinner for 5 turned into a wine tasting for 5. We all learned something, and chose a bottle, which was great. We dared not ask its cost though we had asked for ""value."" A few ""tasting"" rounds of apps, some salads, and some great entrees, I had the pork, done nicely, and the to die for deserts..... we picked up another bottle. The check arrived and our new favorite was only $30, very nice Purple, very nice.But what blows me away about this place is the size of the space. It has got to be one of the biggest, openest venues in seattle with the giant wine rack spiraling up the middle.

The roasted red pepper & goat cheese one is something I have cravings for from time to time, and the apple, walnut & stilton salad is great, too (it comes with a light, sweet, interesting champagne vinaigrette).Mondays are half-price bottle night. Recently, I was here with two friends and we shared a cheese flight to start, then we each had an entree and dessert, plus we shared a great bottle of pinot noir. It worked out to $33 each, including tip. You can't beat that!Their sorbets are always creative, fresh and delicious, and I love their sea salt caramels (you can now get an order of sea salt caramels to go, by the way! They make a great hostess gift).I love the decor here, too. Service is a tad slow, but knowledgable and friendly. When my husband and I went to lunch here as a little celebration on the day we picked up our marriage certificate, they brought us out champagne and sea salt caramels--on the house!We go here five or six times a year, and every single experience has been great!"

Food overpriced - $16 for a hamburger slightly larger than a slider. Very salty and undercooked. The side that came with it....pickled onion. 3. Why our two pasta dishes were served in a french onion soup crock.....no idea. Pasta was mushy, over salted and lackluster.4. The smell in the restaurant was very off pudding. I could go on.

Musang Seattle,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/musang-seattle-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Evan J.,2.0,6/1/2022,6,WA,Unimpressive meal. French toast was cold when served. Only one server for the entire indoor dining area during weekend brunch time. therefore sluggish service.
Musang Seattle,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/musang-seattle-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Aaron B.,3.0,2/6/2025,16,CA,"I was really looking forward to celebrating my mother's birthday at Musang, especially after highlighting the occasion on our reservation. Unfortunately, the experience fell short in several ways. Despite our clear instructions, the staff completely overlooked the birthday, even going so far as to bring a dessert for the birthday celebrant at the table next to us. To add to the mix, our leche flan was forgotten for about 15 minutes until we had to remind them.On a positive note, the ambience was quite nice and the setting is definitely inviting. However, the service needs a lot of work if they hope to match the quality of their decor. Overall, a decent spot with plenty of potential, but the service mishaps really detracted from what should have been a special celebration. Three stars."
Musang Seattle,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/musang-seattle-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Queenie W.,3.0,8/10/2022,16,CA,Not open on 8/10. There wasn't a notice or anything on the window :c kinda disappointing
Musang Seattle,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/musang-seattle-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Michele S.,4.0,1/12/2024,243,WA,"I finally snagged reservations for Musang at a decent hour for dining with friends on a weeknight after work (plan ahead folks!). I was super excited to try this ""elevated"" Filipino food, as my experience of Filipino food has been more limited and more casual. The interior was inviting and warm, design that has been considered but isn't fussy or pretentious. The waitstaff were friendly and informative, able to answer our questions about ingredients and portions to share everything family style. I started with an Ube Lemon Soda. Wow, don't miss this delicate, refreshing vanilla lemon drink! I knew I definitely wanted the lumpiang and pancit, my go-to Filipino choices. My dining companions had little to no exposure to Filipino food and one person doesn't eat anything with seafood, so family style eating limited what i would normally choose just a bit. I am not a huge beef fan, but l love short ribs and the wait person recommended them, so that was our main. We rounded out dinner with a Brussels sprouts dish and garlic rice. Lumpiang and pancit are definitely done deliciously here. We were all scraping the pancit sauce onto our rice (definitely get the garlic rice!). The lumpiang probably has one of the best wrappers I have ever tasted, and the filling was a perfect blend of minced pork and shrimp, with an excellent vinegar based dipping sauce (sawsawan). The major disappointment of the evening was the short rib Kare Kare. Impressively sized and beautifully presented with a pool of peanut sauce and perfectly cooked veg tucked to the side, our meat was tough, chewy and difficult to get off the bone. The sauce/meat combo was flat and one dimensional. I have read other reviews of this dish where the meat was clearly prepared better, and described as ""fall off the bone."" Sadly we did not get that version of the dish. At $52 this was a dish no one wanted to finish or eat much of. The most delicious sounding dessert on the menu (a spiced apple ice cream dish) was not available, so we tried the corn bibinka. This was like a chewy rice flour cornbread with warm honey butter. Tasty, but not something I would order again, especially for dessert. Every seat was full during our 7PM visit and we were notified ahead of arriving dining time would be limited to 1 hour 45 minutes for a party of 3 due to turnover, as well as 22% service charge (they are very good about letting you know you don't have to add gratuity, but you are prompted when paying to choose a percentage or ""no tip"". Eater Reader, I can't choose no tip.) I don't have a problem with any of this for an experience, but it's not a structure I am going to generally choose for my average dining out. If someone wanted to go to Musang and invited me, I would definitely say yes, but I don't think it will be on my list of go-to suggestions unless I am looking for a special occasion restaurant in that part of town due to price, turnover pressure (which they aren't overt about), and difficulty in getting a reservation. However, it is definitely worth having the experience, whether you already love Filipino food or need an introduction. P.S. No pics because this was a night for enjoying company with friends who don't photograph their food."
Musang Seattle,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/musang-seattle-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Jimmy S.,4.0,1/16/2021,22,WA,I really liked both their spring rolls and their squers

Musang Seattle,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/musang-seattle-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Mark C.,5.0,8/30/2023,14,WA,"From the moment I took my first bite of the Kare-Kare short ribs, my taste buds were treated to an symphony of flavors that left me in awe.The menu has an impressive array of options, each one crafted with evident care and attention to detail. Every dish was a masterpiece, blending ingredients in ways that showcased the chef's exceptional skill and creativity with Filipino dishes. And let's not forget the dessert the bibingka creation that balanced sweetness, texture, and visual appeal in a harmonious marriage.The service matched the quality of the food, with a staff that was attentive, knowledgeable, and passionate about the culinary offerings. If you're seeking a dining experience that transcends the ordinary and elevates your appreciation for fine cuisine, this is the place to be. Without a doubt, I'll be returning to savor more of their exceptional offerings in the near future."

Highly recommend making reservations if you plan on dining in. Wait time about 90 minutes when we came in, but was absolutely worth the wait with their hospitality alone. Food was delicious! The sauce for the lumpia was really good. Sisig and fried chicken was good. The gravy for the chicken was good on the chicken and the rice! For dessert we had the tsokoleyt tibok-tibok, which is like a mousse and was absolutely delicious that we ordered a second one. Very friendly staff and even made our youngest some puréed squash. Thank you for the excellent dining experience!!!"

I grew up with a lot of Filipino friends, and the food here brought back a lot of memories eating at their house. After dinner we noticed the Ube cheesecake wasn't on the menu. But the waiter was so amazing to get us some, off the secret menu and I was not let down. Go and try this place!"

Musang Seattle,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/musang-seattle-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=10,Del M.,5.0,2/8/2020,1,WA,"We are new CA transplants (please don't hate us) and not particularly familiar with the area. I wanted to take my Filipina wife somewhere special for her birthday. All the positive reviews here are spot on - trust them implicitly.Service. It abounds here. While we had an admittedly long wait because it was Friday night peak dinner hours the hostess was so gracious and polite throughout our time, and was so with all guests coming and going despite the pace; never once did she look flustered or less than cool (even when some expressed frustration when politely explained about the expected wait). She was also spot on with our wait estimate which to me also demonstrated she has her finger on the pulse of the place and knows her craft. This gracious humble knowledge permeated all staff. Our server was awesome, on top of things, aware of the menu and could explain about the dish nuances from a deep awareness that reflected passion not a disinterested standardized script being rattled off to get it over with. Patient and kind. She was also perfectly present - there at just the right moments without hovering. We met the sous chef later and I think she and my wife must have chatted for over a half hour and while much of it was in Tagalog so I only caught bits and pieces or when she intentionally shifted to English because she was intentionally including me - in any case it was warm and vulnerable filled with cheer and the joy present in hearing of my wife's experiences that night were evident (despite her being at the tail end of a 17hr on her feet bustling around day).Wow I can't believe I've written this much and haven't even gotten to the main attraction...THE FOOD!! I don't have the childhood memories to tie everything in emotionally but can say everything was delicious. Some uninformed or close minded purists might decry it's not authentic enough because various ingredients were swapped out. However they could not be more mistaken. Substitutions were the hallmarks of the dishes and epitomized Filipino traditions to use local use fresh and don't waste. Any changes were done with thought and care, creativity and artistry. You might notice a subtle difference but nothing ""doesn't belong"" and, at risk of heresy, manifest themselves as overall improvements to fix something not quite right in the original. From the very first bite my wife's eyes welled up with tears of joy and remembrance to days of her youth. This flood of thought and recollection permeated the evening as each new dish presented elicited a fresh cascade of memories and tears and left her feeling, really feeling, like her dearly missed and departed Momma had returned for her special birthday to cook her a treat.We look forward to many more evenings and special meals here and eager to see and experience what new seasonal flairs the talented chefs can come up with.Thank you again to all of the staff at Musang, for making a night to remember.(Sorry I didn't get into deep detail, but for reference we had: Lumpiang, Bola Bola, Sinigang, Steamed Rice, Beef Mechado, and then wrapped everything up with Flan Cake and Tibok Tibok -- there's nothing we had that I wouldn't recommend and the only thing that would prevent me from ordering each again would be wanting to try everything else on the menu)"

Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Marco S.,1.0,3/15/2024,3,UT,This american restaurant that sells premium pretend italian food is a disgrace to the italian culinary culture. This restaurant is an absolute insult to the great Piemonte region of italy.

Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Caleb E.,2.0,3/11/2016,10,WA,"Great service but wildly overpriced meals. We each had a pasta since we wanted to get some variety. My friend had the ""famous"" butter and sage, and I had the pork and beef ragu. The food was okay, but to pay $28 for a bowl of pasta is just over the top. Again, service was great, but I just can't recommend anyone pay that much for a bowl of noodles. The waiter recommended we split a pasta because they said the portion was large...which might be true if the noodles were thicker. We both finished ours in under 10 minutes (without rushing!)"

The food was high quality, and we expected the prices are to be that expensive, knowing the location. The bits are large enough to share, and the roasted meat special was a fantastic choice. You can't go wrong here. We were looking forward to getting back to try more of their dishes."

We ordered one dish from each section of the menu and were pleased with each one. Every single appetizer option is to die for. Unfortunately, the seating is a little awkward not sure why two tables would be placed in the center of the restaurant where servers and other patrons need to be walking by. Be prepared for extremely uncomfortable chairs and slow service. It was a 3 hour dining experience with a lot of wait time between each dish."

I always think good wine must be paired with good food which this place deserves. However, I didn't like the food being served in common plate to be shared with 2 other diners. I highlighted this to the waitress but my suggestion was not taken seriously. service"
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Anthony E.,4.0,8/9/2023,4,WA,On the menu there's an option to order EVERYTHING. That's what we did. It was a great experience by itself. The food are mostly tasty. The fresh pasta taste so good - especially liked the mini ravioli with rabbit. The duck breast and the tuna mayo appetizer also stand out. The service was exceptional as well. Overall it was a great experience
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Jose S.,4.0,6/18/2023,2,WA,We went with a group of 8 and did the family style Degustazione where they literally bring you everything on the menu over multiple courses. And it is not a small amount of food. Our waiter was fabulous and warned us that we should pace ourselves and he was right.
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Abigail C.,4.0,11/15/2021,12,CA,"After being told repeatedly that we needed to try Spinasse we finally did. I would say that it largely lived up to its reputation. The staff were extremely professional but also friendly. The menu had enough variation to make it possible for several different experiences but we made the mistake of ordering a succession of incredibly rich dishes rather than something light and crisp between the rich items. That said, everything was exceptional, if a bit much, but we had a great dinner and would highly recommend Spinasse, not that they need our endorsement."

This is probably the best spot I have gone to for lunch. Just improved my evening. On the off chance that you are searching for an incredible early lunch detect this is it. This place has some of the best Italian food, I can count on my hands how many times I've enjoyed a great meal!"

Everything that they put in front of us was very tasty. The only negative was that even though we reserved a table a month in advance we were seated by the door.

The atmosphere and decor is nice enough and gives a good neighborhood italian family spot to eat. Service is friendly, but slow. The value for what you get was off-par. The shrimp were less than fresh, the salad was too trendy to be friendly - I don't know who started this trend, but a half wedge of lettuce that you have to cut up yourself does not make a salad enjoyable, nor contribute to a ""neighborhood"" vibe. Too high-end of an idea there--which I find really isn't enjoyable at any restaurant. Lunch or bar use might be better time to visit. Would not go back for dinner."

Overall an ok experience, but don't know if I agree with all the positive press it's getting. Pro's: Very good tasting food, simple and very nice atmosphere/ambience, good wine list and pleasant staff.Con's: Limited menu - especially the much talked about pasta dishes, nice waitress, but slow service,We'll give it another try, but I'm not in a hurry to get back anytime soon."

Holy lord that is the best pasta I've ever and I mean EVER had in this town (the only close rival I can think of is Volterra in Ballard). Pair it with carrots, and you've got one perfect meal. We LOVE this place! Great atmosphere (although avoid sitting at the bar as it does seem to draw some poser-types, and you'll be subjected to their annoying conversations) ... and go early or make reservations as the space is a tad cramped. Service is okay, but you get the sense, sometimes, that they don't really like you and that they have better things to do or that they're more sophisticated than you (which is why I'm giving it 4 rather than 5 stars -- oh, and because it's a bit cramped) ... but the food is truly amazing. Promise."

Three letters- WOW! It was hard to get a reservation earlier than 8:30, but it was worth the wait. The staff was great, our waitress was so really knowledgable, helpful and funny. There was only one thing I didn't like, Campari and Soda is not my drink of choice. Now that's out of the way... everything that was delicious... the hand cut egg pasta with butter and sage, so simple... but it was my favorite thing. My favorite entree was the whole rainbow trout. Perfectly cooked. I suggest you let the waiter fillet it for you. And then finish the meal off with a pot of Herkimer coffee. We had friends in from out of town and this is a meal we'll always rememeber."

We'll be going back soon!"
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Jasper T.,5.0,10/9/2023,41,WA,"Spinasse has firmly secured its place as our absolute favorite restaurant, and every visit here is nothing short of a gastronomic delight. If there were a way to give this place more than five stars, I would do so without hesitation.Our latest visit to Spinasse was a testament to why we keep returning. We couldn't resist ordering our all-time favorites - the Ragu and Short Rib.The Ragu at Spinasse is, in a word, perfection. It's the kind of dish that makes you wonder if the chefs have secretly discovered a portal to Italy to source their ingredients. Handcrafted with love, the pasta was the ideal canvas for the rich, meaty, and profoundly satisfying ragu sauce. Each bite was a revelation, a harmonious blend of flavors that danced on our taste buds. It's a dish that defines comfort food; every spoonful warms the soul.The Short Rib is a true showstopper. The succulent, tender meat practically melts in your mouth, and the depth of flavors is nothing short of mesmerizing. The presentation is a work of art, but the real masterpiece is the taste. The slightly sweet undertones complement the savory richness of the dish, creating a symphony of flavors that's nothing short of extraordinary.Now, onto the only downside - getting a reservation! It's no secret that Spinasse is a sought-after dining destination, and it's not surprising, given their exceptional experience. The only drawback is that it can be challenging to secure a table, especially for impromptu visits. But I suppose that's a testament to their well-deserved popularity.The ambiance at Spinasse is intimate and inviting, making it perfect for a romantic evening or a special celebration. The staff is knowledgeable and incredibly accommodating, which adds to the overall charm of the place.In conclusion, Spinasse is a culinary treasure in Seattle, and their Ragu and Short Rib dishes are the stuff of dreams. While getting a reservation might require some planning, the experience is more than worth it. If you're a fan of authentic Italian cuisine served with passion and precision, Spinasse is a must-visit. It's our go-to place for creating cherished memories over exceptional food, and we can't wait for our next visit!"

Overall, great indoor and outdoor experience, pretty chic and romantic. The drinks are pretty good, but a bit strong. They have a wide selection of pizzas, portions of pasta, salads, and other small plates. The margarita pizza is pretty tasty, thin, and doughy. It could have been a bit crispier, but still good.

To start, we had the Antipasto Misto which was a taste of each of the appetizers. A great way to taste lots of their dishes. All of the pasta is homemade and I think we have tasted each of their pastas over two visits and have loved all of them. The lamb Agnolotti, which is a ravioli type pasta, is particularly good. Nice wine selection too. Highly recommend."

The fried squash was very crispy and complimented the warm and dense ricotta cheese inside. Next we ate beef tongue which fell apart in my mouth. It was very delicious. We ordered the butter and sage pasta as well as the beef/pork ragu pasta. The butter and sage pasta just melted in my mouth. I could have eaten to servings of it. The beef ragu was equally delicious and reminded me of a more gourmet version of Skyline Chili. Lastly, we enjoyed the rabbit meatballs. They were well seasoned and tender. I would come back and order everything again!! Everything was very very good. I plan to bring out of towners/family here in the future!"

I was a little concerned when I looked at the menu because I didn't understand half the words and the ones that I did looked a little scary...(ground liver??). I was pleasantly surprised with everything I had. My friend did all the ordering for us and I couldn't say anything bad as each dish was better than the last! The ground liver paste on a cracker was surprisingly delectable. The butter and sage noddles melted in my mouth. Next time I want to try the rabbit meatballs!!
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Niki M.,5.0,8/3/2017,4,CA,My favorite restaurant in Seattle! I was given this recommendation by a fellow wine lover and it over delivered. The menu is Piemonte inspired and the wine list is amazing. Loved every dish we ordered and the wine of course!

We moved to Seattle a year ago and while we have found a lot of great restaurants, Cascina Spinasse continues to be a favorite. The service is warm but professional and the setting is great. Regarding the food, just simple, fresh, amazing dishes. The pasta with butter is as great as everyone says but we've loved everything we've tried there. Great neighborhood spot (and we travel from Bellevue to dine there)."
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Amy L.,5.0,8/6/2016,48,WA,"This was my favorite restaurant we visited while in Seattle! We were late arriving to our reservation due to traffic (like an hour late) and they couldn't have been more gracious and accommodating. We were greeted with an incredible amuse bouche that was out of this world. The restaurant is charming and quaint, the music is perfect, the dining room volume perfect, the lighting perfect, the table spacing perfect. It has an old world Italian cafe meets slightly Seattle industrial feel going on. The restaurant is not pretentious in the least! Their open kitchen offers peek a boo views into what looks like a movie set... pasta station with fresh ravioli being made, all with rustic mood lighting instead of sterile and fluorescent bulbs. The service was elegant, restrained, yet casual and personable. Everyone's food was incredible. Several decided it was the best Italian dish they'd ever had. The dessert was unreal.. Get the blackberry chocolate... It will rock your world with utterly perfect simplicity. The bar has 8 or so open seats... when we come back we'll head straight there for drinks and better views of the action. And of course more mind blowing food."

Will be smiling about this meal for days. I have been bending my fiance's ear about this place since October. Finally got here tonight and it exceeded expectations. It's a Sunday and we got an 8:30 reservation- make sure to call ahead or use Open Table! Our waiter (Luis) was attentive and knowledgeable without being pretentious. He recommended a perfect wine to get us started. The anchovy topped buttered crostini set the tone- simple and spectacular! The little corner table by the window was so romantic. We started with a chickpea insalata with marinated rabbit and homemade mayo- amazing. It went perfectly with the wonderful bread. Next we had the famous butter and sage pasta and a new rabbit sausage pasta primi. For secondi we both had the pork shoulder- braised and slow cooked with anchovy and lemon- good God! There just aren't words. Our server got the rabbit sausage recipe from the chef for us (fiancé makes wild game sausage) and brought me an excellent grappa to finish things out. I could die happy!!! Will be back again and again- next time plan to try the extravagant tasting menu. Believe the hype- this place earns it's five stars in every way.

These guys are actually Americans which surprised me at first because the entries were unusually special. My expectations were high because of a friend's description. She was here with some friends during a girl night out and recently surprised me with her invitation. My expectations were met.I'm hooked! It's a little pricy but well worth it.
Olmstead,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/olmstead-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Brian P.,3.0,1/12/2020,106,WA,"Very happy to see something finally open up in the former Broadway Grille location. Absolutely great location.The good:- Food is decent. Better than a diner, not too pretentious, priced reasonably. - Cocktails are great! Menu is a lot more interesting than I expected. Really diverse selection. - Service was fine - I'm sure they're still just getting sorted out.The not-so-great:- Fries could have been cooked a little longer (a tad soggy)- Hamburger bun was soggy-ish - needed to be pre-toasted- My their-take-on-a-Jungle-Bird-but-with-Calvados was a little too _dry_ for what the drink is, which was surprising (used to seeing tiki-ish drinks come out too sweet; this was actually the opposite.) Campari needs to be tamed; about a half teaspoon of simple syrup may have been in order.Overall, though, I'm optimistic about the food and service and think they'll dial it in. However, The bad:The place was barely remodeled from Broadway Grille days; they put some paint, paneling and wallpaper up and that's about it. So what this means is it is extremely loud in this restaurant. While not as bad as some places (I'm still looking at you, Union) I really hope this changes. It makes for an unpleasant dining experience.There are essentially no soft surfaces or acoustical panels at all in their front dining area which means it's mostly concrete and glass. I'm sure it'll be better in the summer when they can open the garage doors but that's only a few months out of the year.The back larger area by the bar has the advantage of height so it's likely less noisy (we didn't dine back there) but still going to be a problem especially if they plan on using the stage.There's a difference between ""festive"" noise levels and ""I literally cannot hear the person three feet away from me on the other side of the table when he speaks at a normal volume"" so I really, really hope you guys get this under control. I shouldn't have to be carrying earplugs with me to a restaurant just to get through my meal without feeling assaulted by the background noise.And yes, this is becoming a cause of mine - this city has a real problem with noise in bars and restaurants but _not everyone_ has the problem to the same degree. Some new restaurants do, in fact, get it right.Overall, though, on the right track and will check it out again in a few months."

Paju,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paju-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Elizabeth R.,2.0,7/1/2024,3,GA,Had a mimosa here for $6 (6.50 ish if counting tax). Good place to get your food and sit down for a drink in the middle of cravings. Honestly a little pricey for not a full glass (it was more half or 2/3s) I would've liked but overall it was fine.
Paju,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paju-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Sammy B.,4.0,8/20/2024,55,WA,"We had reservations for dinner, but had to wait and the smoky smell was pretty overwhelming. The service was slow, and we waited a lot. The Octopus dish was too salty, but the Mushroom was great. The Seafood Jeon was good, and I really liked the Sujebi. The ribeye was okay, but nothing special for the price. Overall, it was a pleasant experience, but maybe a bit overpriced."
Paju,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paju-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Amaris C.,4.0,4/1/2023,22,WA,"Paju is a high-end Korean fusion restaurant that aims to offer a unique dining experience by combining traditional Korean flavors with modern cooking techniques. While I enjoyed my meal at Paju, I have to say that I wasn't blown away by the flavors.The dishes at Paju are beautifully presented and prepared with care. The staff is knowledgeable and attentive, making sure that every guest feels welcome and taken care of. However, I have to admit that the flavors didn't seem to mesh together perfectly in my experience. For example, the squid ink kimchi fried rice was well-prepared and tasted good, but it didn't have that wow factor that I was hoping for. It essentially tasted like a squid ink pasta but with rice and some kimchi thrown in, which was good but not amazing.That being said, I would still recommend giving Paju another try. The restaurant clearly puts a lot of effort into their dishes, and it's possible that other menu items may be more to your liking. Additionally, the atmosphere of the restaurant is upscale and sophisticated, making it a great choice for a special occasion or a night out.Overall, while my experience at Paju was good, I didn't find the food to be amazing. However, I would be willing to give it another try in the future, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high-end Korean fusion dining experience."
Paju,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paju-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Chopard J.,5.0,11/27/2024,9,WA,"As soon as you approach, the inviting scent of a crackling wood-fire grill instantly brings to mind warm, joyful memories of campfire gatherings--a perfect prelude to the meal ahead. The menu showcases an exciting mix of flavors, and I couldn't help but marvel at the grilled branzino, which was cooked to perfection. Even more impressive was the duck, which arrived with beautifully crispy skin and a rich, succulent taste. The banchan, Paju-style, accompanying these grilled dishes were a delightful and refreshing complement, balancing the flavors perfectly.The bar offers some delicious cocktails. I can't wait to return!"
Paju,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paju-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Michele D.,5.0,4/13/2024,13,FL,Food was incredible. I enjoyed food I never thought I would! Unique! Service was perfect.
Paju,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paju-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Mark S.,5.0,1/3/2024,8,WA,"From the moment you step into Paju, you're embraced by an atmosphere that's both modern and welcoming, blending a touch of elegance with the ultimate comfort. It's the kind of place where you instantly feel at ease, yet excited for the culinary journey ahead.Let's dive into their menu, where each dish is a testament to Paju's commitment to quality and innovation. The hamachi crudo, paired with the tartness of granny Smith apples, is a refreshing start, balancing flavors with finesse. The oxtail tacos are a standout - the use of crispy seaweed shells is ingenious, enclosing tender, flavor-packed meat that's nothing short of a taste sensation. And the octopus? It's a triumph in tenderness, matched with a sauce that elevates it to a whole new level of deliciousness. In fact, every dish we tried was a hit, leaving no room for disappointment.Service at Paju is as impeccable as their food. The staff isn't just friendly; they're genuinely enthusiastic about their offerings, guiding you through each dish with knowledge and charm. It's the kind of service that makes a great meal unforgettable.A pro tip for fellow food enthusiasts: visit Paju with a group. Why? Because you'll want to order everything on the menu, and trust me, it's all worth trying. It's a gastronomic adventure that's best shared."

Paju,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paju-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=10,Gail L.,5.0,8/15/2019,7,WA,Best meal I have ever had! Modern Korean. Chef relocated from a 2 star Michelin rated restaurant in NYC. Great food and atmosphere. Going to bring some other friends back later this week.3 days later....I have now officially tried everything on the menu and there I promise you every dish is over the top fantastic! Chef Jeong knew I was coming back with a friend for her birthday and he made a special dish and cake for her. My son made me promise to bring home the Truffle Bulgogi and Panna Cotta for him which he loved when he was in with me a few days ago. Chef Jeong even accommodated my daughter who is extremely difficult to please and she wanted seconds. My friends who I dined with tonight agree this is the best food they have ever had. I describe it as a party in my mouth one dish after another.
Paju,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paju-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=10,Brooks R.,5.0,8/12/2019,6,WA,"Wow, what a great addition to the neighborhood! This was a Korean food experience unlike anything I've ever had.I first took note of this place last week while it was still under construction. They had a sign posted in the window advertising ""modern Korean food"", and with Korean being one of my favorite cuisines, I was super intrigued and resolved to stop by next time I was visiting SIFF (it's right around the corner from the Uptown.)Last night was that night and seriously, the food here is unreal. There was only one other table of patrons during my visit so the chef (who's also the owner) came out and chatted with us for a while. He's SUPER nice and apparently he was the chef de cuisine for Jungsik (a 2 Michelin Star Korean restaurant in NYC) before moving out here a couple years ago to raise his kids. Color me impressed.Anyway, back to the food. The menu here is pretty small (there were about 8 dishes) so I think I tried about half of its contents.I started with the Sweet and Spicy Wings. Two things I want to emphasize: 1) the wings are very large and meaty (which more than justifies the $13 for 6 pieces price point), and 2) these are literally the best wings I've ever had. Perfectly cooked, impossibly crispy, and so so so flavorful with just the right amount of kick. This was absolutely the star of the show and I can't recommend it enough.Next up was the Endive Salad. I almost skipped this item because the menu literally just says ""Endive"" as the title of the dish and I didn't realize it was a salad, but the server suggested it and I'm SO glad I tried it. The ingredients were interesting: endive, burrata, sunflower seeds, orange, and a smoked vinaigrette. I've literally never tasted anything like it. It's smoky and citrusy and refreshing all at once. The flavor profile is so complex and I implore any adventurous eaters to give this a try. It's simply wonderful.For the entree, I went with the Truffle Bulgogi. I was hesitant because I think truffle is a little played out as a flavor and usually when a dish incorporates it, it overwhelms the entire dish. I wasn't thrilled about the prospect of having my beef drenched in truffle oil but the server highly recommended it so I figured what the hell? Once again, Paju won me over with this one. The bulgogi is pretty straightforward in terms of what you'd expect flavor-wise but with some nice touches to elevate the dish: rib eye for the beef; crispy quinoa to add a little crunch; beautifully sliced shitake mushrooms on top. It plays really nicely against the truffle, which is much more subtle (thankfully) than I was expecting. The rice was well seasoned (that's not to say it was salty) and much like the salad, all the flavors came together perfectly. My only complaint with this dish is I wanted something to give it a little kick (I like spicy!) I feel like some fresh chilis or spicy kimchi would've sufficed so hopefully they'll find a way to accommodate us fire chasers down the road as they establish themselves.I was stuffed by this point in the meal (which is saying something given my insatiable appetite) and was prepared to call it a night when the kitchen sent out a complimentary Panna Cotta for me to try. Hooooooooly shit it was good! It was served in a cup and topped with a citrusy syrup (grapefruit perhaps?), sliced grapefruit, sweetened granola, and fresh blackberries. You guys. This is the stuff dreams are made of, and I generally don't use hyperbole. It was absolutely unreal.A trip to Paju will cost you a bit more than a standard trip to your neighborhood takeout joint, but they're playing a whole different game over here. It's upscale dining in a casual atmosphere with a hospitable staff and ambitious chef. I've just never had Korean food quite like this. Rachel Yang, you're on notice -- there's a new player in town. If they can hang on long enough to establish themselves, Chef Jeong seems destined to shake the whole game up."

Once inside its an amazing looking little space almost like old Seattle vibe. We ordered the chicken burger and it was pink in the middle twice, Fish tasted like old seaweed, not to mention the kitchen staff didn't even have hair nets!! One of em looked like an Irish butler with his 1940s hat, they must have one of those programs where they hire the homeless. drinks came out extremely odd tasting. When we asked the bartender what was some of the alcohols used were she said "" idk it's my 1st day"". The place doesn't have security so the homeless wonder in aimlessly. Our server told us that a homeless person came in with a Knife last week and cops had to be called while guests restrained him!!! Im not trying to get stabbed while I eat out. It's connected to another bar so the bathroom is shared, homeless people in the bathroom clogging up the toilets and overflowing into the hallway which made the place smell horrible. We asked for a manager but one was not on duty they said. There are better places to eat around town I'd stay far away from this place. -10/10 Dumpster Level"

The oversized empanadas are a force to be reckoned with, packed to the brim with goodness. The Brussels sprouts dish, on the other hand, is a real winner, a taste explosion. Sadly, the wings are forgettable, and the sangria won't make your day. The hot sauce selection sounds intriguing, even though I didn't get to dive into it. As for the black cod dish, it had potential, but it left room for improvement. It's a rollercoaster of tastes, and just when you thought it couldn't get more interesting, a fight breaks out outside - an unexpected twist in this culinary adventure."

The atmosphere was pretty standard for a bar - dim lighting and loud music. The drinks weren't my favorite or anything. I wasn't a fan to be honest. They just taste like straight up alcohol, no flavor in the cocktails. The prices were a bit high.The food at Deadline Bar was also just okay. I tried the garlic parmesan fries and they were pretty standard - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They were served with a side of ketchup. Overall, the fries were nothing special.All in all, I would say that Deadline Bar is a decent spot if you're looking for a place to grab a drink with friends and have never been before. Worth a try. Would I go again? No. The atmosphere is pretty standard, the drinks are not the worst and the food is okay. It's not the best bar I've ever been to, but it's not the worst either.

I had popped into this place a few times on my way to a game or when at a show at the Central and service has always been amazing, and now if I'm near Pioneer Square I make a point to stop into this wonderful establishment. My husband and I even ended up doing a small court wedding and having our reception here in one of their private rooms, The Gold Room. Bar service wise; they had a server that seemed to be completely dedicated to our needs and was very timely on making sure everyone was satisfied. The bar staff even came up with custom cocktails for my husband and I that many of our guests fell in love with. Kitchen wise; I was blown way by the cuisine. My husband being from Mexico originally, it was very important to me to be able to have the most authentic South American cuisine I could get (even if it wasn't Mexican specifically). The kitchen staff far exceeded my expectations by not only being amazing chefs in columbian inspired cuisine but, by asking if there was anything in particular that my husband missed from home. To the point where one of them called their mom asking for a family recipe. Needless to say my husband had food that night that he had not had for 3+ years. The staff in both bar and kitchen made the night extremely easy and unforgettable by the service of phenomenal cocktails and food. For the record the staff members that created this amazing experience where Rich (Event Coordinator), Phillipè (Chef), Tanner (Chef), and Jim (Bartender that was handed our event), and Cody (Bartender)"

Rondo,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/rondo-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Beatrice L.,1.0,5/30/2021,8,WA,"I heard amazing things about this restaurant. I read all the stellar reviews of this place written by fellow yelpers. I saw all the pictures. I went with high expectations. Maybe it may have been different had we dined in. Who knows, but what I ordered vs what I paid...something doesn't seem right to me. First, the uni ikura bowl. As you can see, the amount of uni in this bowl is ridiculous. Granted, they said it's not uni season and that uni they have are quite small...ok.... but when you charge me $58 for this bowl, I expect a little better. Let me go back on the price of this item. This donburi is originally $38. That's what's listed on the menu. No where on their website or at the restaurant, does it say price will adjust depending on availability. No where does it say it will adjust as we'll be paying market price, but they said they'll have to charge us $58 because it's not uni season. We paid the price thinking we'd at least get what we paid for. What we got is actually not even worth $38. Sorry. I think you could have done a whole lot better Rondo. If this is all the uni you had, maybe you shouldn't be selling any uni dishes, rather than hiking up the price.  Bara chirashi - this was ok. Not as outrageous as the $58 bowl. Was it worth $22? Unsure. Maybe I would have justified it had it not been for the $58 mess. Don't get me wrong. I'm not ranting because I'm cheap. I'll gladly pay $58 ..80..100 IF my food matches what I pay for. But for an establishment that serves many uni dishes, you should have either 1) not sell any after explaining low stock/low availability/ 2) explain low stock/low availability and charge the normal price 3) OR charge $58 and give that much + add something else to the donburi to justify that price."

It was unpleasant and very disappointing."
Rondo,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/rondo-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Ced C.,2.0,10/20/2021,103,CA,"For the prices, especially during happy hour, I was really expecting more. I was quite disappointed after having read all the yelp and Google reviews. Hopefully, we just ordered the wrong items during happy hour, at least the wait staff seemed helpful. Their daily menu included a blue fin tuna handroll. We opted for the additional uni since it sounded like it was fresh from Santa Monica. We tried some uni from Santa Monica from another Seattle Japanese restaurant, Kamonegi, and it was extremely fresh. Sadly, we were disappointed with the uni from Rondo as it was either not as fresh or was a bad batch since it apparently came from the same source. The bluefin tuna seemed decently fresh and the ikura seemed pretty fresh. The handroll overall was still decent, perhaps 4/5.The Yuzu Ebi Mayo was 5 pieces of shrimp covered in a mayo mixed sauce over some green spring mix (similar mix from grocery stores). Nothing too special about this one, tasted decent, 2/5.Tasty B.B. Noodle - Uni and IkuraThis dish reminded me of a creamy pasta dish with extra parmesan cheese. There was a bit of uni and ikura in the mix as well. The uni was the same Santa Monica uni from earlier and could be fresher, especially for the price. 2/5.Bara-Chirashi DonburiThis was the reason why we tried this place, and unfortunately, we were disappointed. There were two small thin pieces of wagyu in here which is understood since its not cheap, definitely on the well done side. The wagyu was pretty good, but it was drowned out by the over seasoned rice. The rest of the sashimi seemed to be decently fresh, however, the rice was overly seasoned which drowned out the flavor of the sashimi. The donburi was quite small for the price, especially during happy hour. 2/5.Overall, pretty high price tag for happy hour in Seattle. Was hoping to get swept off my feet as far as quality goes but was disappointed. Who knows, maybe I ordered all the wrong dishes which is why this place has glowing reviews. For now, I don't think I'd return as there are many other happy hour spots to try while in Seattle."

Rainbow Uni Shooter ($9): I loved the combination of uni, ikura, tobiko, quail egg, nori puree, and umami soy on sushi rice. It was like a little meal in a small sake cup. The balance was just right, making it a standout dish.Corn Kara-ge ($7): I'm not entirely sure what is basted in the corn, but it tasted like miso butter to me. It was lightly roasted and had a good savory flavor with the sweet corn kernels. Yum. Uni and Seafood Udon ($24): While a bit on the expensive side, this dish was delicious. My only feedback is that it needed a little more salt and cream sauce, as it was slightly dry.Soft Serve with Miso Caramel ($5): This dessert was delicious! The texture of the ice cream was perfect, and the sweetness level was spot on. My only feedback is that the miso flavor could have been stronger.Overall, I had a great dining experience at Rondo and would definitely return to try their chirashi and bento boxes, which look so tasty!"

Our order included the ox tail soup, bluefin handroll, bara chirashi donburi, and uni maze-don. Everything was fresh and delicious. The uni maze-don was my favorite; I adore uni! The ox tail soup was good, although slightly salty on its own.I'd definitely consider visiting in person next time to try their desserts!"

Highly recommend their Bara Chirashi bowl and Tonkatsu, which was super crispy. The Mr. Pork also tasted great but was kind of heavy. Their fried chicken, however, was a little bit disappointing."

I ordered a spicy tuna bowl, and I could choose between chicken or ribs. How I was sort of hungry, I asked fried chicken. The food was very well prepared, the size of the portion was quite big, but the star of the dish was the sauce. It tastes like an authentic homemade Japanese sauce, and the fried chicken was crunch and tasty.Also, the waiter was courteous and pleasant with all of us."

This place serves so many tasty dishes it makes exploring the menu fun. Some standout favorites include Mr. Pork Rib, Chinese-style curry donuts, spicy red ramen (actually, all the ramen!), the curry, and the donburi. Every dish brings the flavor and soul, so satisfying!It's a fantastic spot for couples or larger groups to share and enjoy together. The staff is absolutely amazing--energetic, positive, and genuinely give a damn that you have a great time.The atmosphere is another highlight for me. It's cozy and relaxed, with a lively vibe from a restaurant full of happy folk super satisfied with everything Rondo dishes up. You can't help but feel the good energy here.Yeah I like this place :)"

Rondo,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/rondo-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=10,Hayley H.,5.0,9/3/2024,3,WA,"Rondo is a gem nestled in Cap Hill, offering an izakaya experience very reminiscent of bars I visited in Japan years ago. I love the ambiance and variety of food and drink options... Slightly biased here because I'm a huge fan of their sister restaurant Tamari Bar, which has a very similar atmosphere and menu offerings.The Rainbow Uni Shooters are a must-try burst of umami, creamy butteriness in a single bite. I usually feel indifferent towards the taste of uni, but I would definitely get these shooters again.Also decided to try the Uni Seafood Creamy Udon. It's exactly what it sounds like: a comforting bowl of udon noodles bathed in a creamy white sauce and topped with uni. Adding this to my list of uni dishes I would order again.The Aburi Salmon Battera Sushi was another flavorful bite. The seared salmon melts in your mouth and the smoky flavor compliments well with the rice.For drinks (forgot to take a picture), my friend and I ordered a matcha gin & tonic and a fruity cocktail I'm forgetting the name of. I thought both were pretty good.Overall, solid food and drink flavors and presentation, inviting ambiance, and attentive service!"

No matter how many times I go to Rondo, I will never get tired of it. With constant new daily specials, a loaded happy hour menu, and impeccable menu staples, there is always delight to be found. My personal favorites are the spicy tuna donburi, the premium bento box, and the spicy tuna crispy sushi bites from the happy hour menu! The service is always fast and the presentation is superb. It's perfect for special outings and casual ones as well. Ordering from the happy hour menu makes it fairly affordable for the quality, but even apart from that, Rondo is worth it!!"

It seem like they have a lot of regulars because they knew each other by name and they sat close to the bar. The service was really great!! The food was some of the best I've had. My partner loves curry so he had it along with an Oxtail Ramen. I had katsudon and Tokyo Shoyu Ramen. In my opinion, the bill was a bit pricey but so worth it. Next time we go we will definitely bring the rest of our family."

My dish of choice was the negi-goma chashu-men. Almost everything about the dish was good. The only issue I had was that the bowl had what seemed like half a bottle of sesame seeds. I'm familiar that they are a part of the dish but that was a lot!
Ramen Danbo,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/ramen-danbo-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=10,Jay Y.,3.0,2/18/2022,13,HI,"One of the worst ramen shop experiences I've ever had. Service was slow, host rude, portions small, and wait way too long. We waited over two hours after trying to call to reserve beforehand but being told that they ""did not do reservations"". After arriving, we were told to join the wait list and would have to wait for at least an hour. By the time we sat down to eat our food, nothing but life-changing ramen could have made this experience better. Unfortunately, this was not life changing."
Ramen Danbo,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/ramen-danbo-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=10,Nhi H.,3.0,7/29/2021,69,WA,I heard a lot about this place but I don't get the excitement surrounding this ramen shop. I went here and got the Shio Rekka Ramen and it was very oily and salty. Was missing a lot and was not very impressed with the meal. There are many other ramen places in the area that I think are better and less wait. I don't know if I'll come back a second time.
Ramen Danbo,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/ramen-danbo-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=10,Kathy L.,3.0,5/29/2019,8,WA,Regular ramen with reasonable price! Not the best in Seattle and not worth for 1hr drive from north. Kinda salty!

The wait outside was a bit long--about 40 minutes--but that's to be expected since the place is pretty popular. While you wait, you pre-order your food on a slip, which streamlines the process once you're seated.Once inside, the food came out surprisingly fast. I ordered the classic ramen with egg and extra chashu, it did not disappoint. The broth was incredibly rich, full of deep, savory flavors, and the noodles were cooked to the perfect texture. The tender, flavorful pork added the perfect touch.Service was excellent--waitstaff were attentive and friendly, making the dining experience enjoyable. The place is on the smaller side, so seating can be a bit tight, but it's definitely worth it for the food. I also noticed they have a stamp reward system, so you can earn free ramen over time, which is a nice bonus.Overall, a really tasty bowl of ramen, and I'd definitely return for another round in the future!"

Ramen Danbo,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/ramen-danbo-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=20,Lucas G.,4.0,12/17/2022,7,WA,"There's a reason there's always a line at this place, and I understand why now. I ordered Negi Chashu. The soup was not too salty or greasy. Super creamy and pretty mellow compared to other ramen I've had. Light but packed with lots of flavor. The noodles were soft and delicate and paired well with the broth. The chashu was soft and not too greasy so it tasted great with the spicy chutney. Usually a very balanced bowl of ramen that is almost perfect. It's a matter of preference, but I'm sure something like pickled ume would be a welcome addition to this bowl. If it was just the food, Denbo would be the closest to the 5, but like most popular spots around Seattle, you're usually pushed into a small corner and forgotten about because of the restaurant. . . How crowded it was. You might gasp at your neighbor at how full the tables are at this restaurant. There's really no room to walk, pass, or even get in or out of your seat without imposing. I had to flag down the wait staff for water, my order, and then my check. I would recommend Denbo if you want a solid bowl of ramen, just have time to wait for your table, and just want a loud time to hangout with friends."

The broth was light and the noodles were perfect! My boyfriend got the negi-goma and he said it was a bit too sesame for his liking. Also, he added a lot of toppings and the bowl was not big enough to hold the broth to match the toppings. His broth got shallow within a few bite. Compared to his ramen, mine would taste like water. However, since I ate mine instead of switching between ours I thought it was enough flavor. The food came out super fast! Service was great."

The classic ramen with thick noodles was nothing short of perfection. The broth was rich and flavorful, enveloping the chewy, thick noodles in a warm embrace that felt like a hug for my taste buds.I paired my ramen with a lunch combo that included gyoza and a refreshing ginger ale. The gyoza were perfectly crispy on the outside and filled with juicy, savory goodness. The ginger ale added a nice, tangy touch to round off the meal.Every bite was a delight, and the service was top-notch.

What truly impressed me was the dedication to cater to all types of diners. As a vegetarian, I often struggle to find flavorful options, but Ramen Danbo truly delivered with their veggie ramens. They have a number of veggie offerings.We tried their veggie miso ramen, seasonal tomato ramen and the sesame ramen, and I was blown away by the explosion of flavors in each bowl. you have the option of choosing noodle thickness, richness of broth and a number of other customization. The veggie miso ram had a velvety miso broth. The depth of the flavors was incredible, and the umami notes from the miso took this bowl to a whole new level. The noodles were perfectly cooked, and every bite had perfect texture and flavor. The tomato ramen was an interesting combination but I enjoyed the other two ramens more. It is a seasonal flavor they have. 3.5/5The sesame ramen, oh my goodness, was a revelation. If you like Sesame you will love this broth. The rich nuttiness of the sesame combined with the savory broth was a match made in ramen heaven. my favorite! 5/5Their veggie gyozas are decent too 4/5- had favorful filling and the dough to filling ratio was Pete! The portion sizes were generous. While there was a wait of 60 minutes to get a table, I can wholeheartedly say that the wait was absolutely worth it. However, I must mention that finding parking around the area was a bit challenging. It took some time to locate a suitable spot, but don't let that deter you from the wonderful dining experience that awaits inside.Highly recommend this place for veggie ramen lovers"

It's the best ramen I've ever had and now I can't get ramen anywhere else because nothing comes close to Danbo.

We were seated, had our order taken and our food came out all in the span of ~5 minutes. Very fast and efficient service...but they weren't busy at all so we weren't rushed at all.I got the Classic Rekka ramen and my boyfriend got the Classic Chashu-men ramen with extra spice.I love all the options to customize and my thick noodles were cooked perfectly al dente (firm), which I enjoyed. I loved my broth, it was very rich and flavorful. It wasn't that spicy but had a nice flavor. The Chashu ramen broth had a cleaner, sweet flavor. My boyfriend mentioned that although he ordered extra spice his had zero spice, but it wasn't that big of a deal.The bowls/portions were rather small, which they work around by offering extra orders of noodles, but still a good sized meal. (Boiled eggs were also a add on).Overall, would recommend coming here if you want to get a quick tasty meal."

The staff here is also so friendly, multiple people came to check on our table which was really nice. Will definitely be back!"

The service was excellent and the staff was super friendly. We kept on getting asked if everything was great and as we finished three staff members took our plates. The best ramen and staff in town! Don't forget to try the gyoza and add the pickled veg to your ramen.
Son of A Butcher,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/son-of-a-butcher-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=0,Josh E.,1.0,8/30/2020,3,WA,I used to love this place but now I don't know what is going on with them. I ordered 2 item pork belly and sullung tang ( Uber eat )but I didn't receive sullung tang at all and pork belly was not even warm as well as missing stuff. I tried to call them but I wasn't able to contact them.
Son of A Butcher,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/son-of-a-butcher-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=0,Wendy A.,1.0,8/8/2020,14,WA,I live in the Eastlake area and have eaten here at least six times. But no more after this evening. My husband and daughter and I went in and this was our experience.  We tried to order the chicken dish which we had the last time we dined here. We were told that we needed to order two meals and we could not split them. So we ordered of the pancakes. Our daughter wanted the volcano egg. So here's where I'm going to give the math breakdown.The Chicken dish is $ 18.00The Volcano egg is   10.00The Kimichi Pancake 14.00Our server came back to the table and said we couldn't order that way because we had to order two of the 18.00 dinner items .I then asked if we could just do a take out order instead. She returned and said we could but that the Volcano Egg couldn't be a take out item. I then asked if we could just sit there and my daughter eat the egg dish while we waited. Now mind you this was at 4:30 and there was only one other table in use. We were told we couldn't do that. I then said fine were leaving. I then explained to the manager or who ever he was about why we were leaving. He wanted to explain to me that on the menu it says that there has to be two orders of the chicken dish. So here's the math again. Two Chicken dishes for 18.00 =   36.00One Chicken Dish and One Kimich Pancacke   18.00+14.00=32.00So it was worth him not at least trying to have us stay and eat at his restaurant for $4.00. He needs to learn about customer service. Also not to mention that his server who we would have tipped 20% missed out as well as we are local to this neighborhood and have been trying to support our local restaurants  But not to worry we walked down the street to HayMaker had a great dinner during their happy hour. The service was great they went out of there way to make sure we enjoyed our meal. I will not be returning to Son of a Butcher and will not be taking my family who we were going to go and eat this up coming week.

Poor presentation. Their in-dining experience was a lot better. There are better takeout Korean options in Seattle. Overall, I dont recommend.....H Mart food is sadly better quality and for a lesser price. Giving a two star for their effort."
Son of A Butcher,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/son-of-a-butcher-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=0,Seattleite W.,5.0,1/15/2025,6,WA,"If you're in Seattle and craving the best Korean BBQ experience, this place is an absolute must-visit. It's located in quiet neighborhoods in Eastlake like a hidden jewel box.The highlight of the meal is undoubtedly the Korean BBQ, which features some of the highest quality cuts of meat I've ever had. Their SOB cuts were tender and flavorful, while the pork belly was perfectly crispy on the edges and succulent in the middle. ( one of the best pork belly I ever had in Korean BBQ!! ) Each meat was grilled to perfection right at your table, adding to the interactive and fun dining experience. The quality of the meats is exceptional--tender, juicy, and full of authentic flavors.But the greatness doesn't stop at the BBQ. The seafood pancake (haemul pajeon) is hands down the best I've ever tasted ( everyone in my group agreed ). Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, with generous chunks of seafood. It's the perfect complement to the grilled meats.The side dishes (banchan) here are next level--each one is fresh, vibrant, and packed with flavor. From the crunchy kimchi to the savory pickled vegetables and silky steamed egg, every bite is a delight. The variety of banchan that comes with the meal elevates the entire experience, offering a great balance to the richness of the BBQ.If you're a fan of Korean cuisine, this place is by far one of the best in the Seattle area. Excellent service, top-notch quality, and an unforgettable meal. Highly recommended!"

The meat quality is top notch. I love their sauces and side dishes, they complement the meal perfectly. The servers were very friendly and attentive.

We ordered brisket and pork belly and the pork belly were excellent that we had to order more. The combo comes with soup, steamed egg and they don't disappoint you.We were smart enough to make a reservation this time to avoid long wait so try to make a reservation. Also, keep in mind that they are short of staff so the service can be a little slow. However, the quality of food and side dishes was still amazing."

We walked up and placed our order online per their instructions. We waited about half an hour for 2 combos. Everything was lukewarm (sandwich, grits and coffee). Maybe they were having an off day.

Instead of being light, buttery and flaky it had the consistency of a muffin. It was not even remotely flaky and the moisture content was too high as a result :( If you want a bland muffin go here."
Biscuit Bitch,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/biscuit-bitch-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,Ewan D.,3.0,1/11/2024,3,WA,Ordered by scanning a QR code and waited for about 20min for my biscuit+gravy+over easy eggs to be ready. Staff was friendly and gave me two stickers after I said I'll share on social media. There was no seating so I had to eat it on the way walking around pike place market. I would say it's just regular biscuit and gravy. Probably good for friend/family hang out. If you're a tourist like I am it's definitely better to walk into the market and save your appetite for the local stores there.

We're all running on fumes here and they were so sweet and upbeat, even when people suck and act rude. We ordered at 9am online and checked at the window between walking around to stay occupied. Yes, we knew there was a wait so I was patient. Between 11am-Noon our food must have been sitting around. I walked up to the window and the gal saw it was sitting there and apologized. I got the text that it was ready *after* we got our food. Bit of a bummer because the food was okay, I got a bacon breakfast sandwich and my friend got a basic biscuit w/jam and honey. She thought it was going to be fresh jam but it was a Smuckers to-go one. Grits were....greasy. Coffee was disappointing. I'll try again on a better day."

Biscuit Bitch,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/biscuit-bitch-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Janet M.,3.0,7/17/2017,7,WA,The basic biscuit is good but definitely it can be two meals for me because it's very greasy and heavy. The cost of the basic biscuit is kinda spendy for what you're getting but try it once to experience what they offer.

The biscuits are absolutely divine--crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside. Paired with their locally sourced honey, it's a combo you can't miss. The honey adds the perfect touch of sweetness that takes the biscuits to another level.We also tried one of the plates, but I wasn't as big a fan of it. It felt like just regular scrambled eggs with gravy and grits on top, nothing too exciting. Still, the biscuits alone are worth the visit, and I'd definitely recommend stopping by just for those!"

I got the Cobb salad with avocado($6 extra) and my friend got the French toast. Both dishes were flavorful and delicious. Service was a bit pushy at times but overall good.The food came to around $30 a person with tips included. I would definitely come back and try the salmon with sourdough as they were out this morning.

We ordered the bacon, egg and cheese biscuit bitch. It was huge! The biscuit was a bit dry, but then again in order to have a structurally sound sandwich, that may be the best way to go. It was a hearty breakfast, and I'd order again! My favorite part of the experience was the dude at the front counter saying, ""order for Kayla! Here's your biscuit, Bitch!"" Next time I'm in Seattle, I'll be back!"

It is over in Belltown. If you miss when it is open here you should definitely go there. There is a more touristy place that is similar over and Pike Place market but this is the one you want to hit! Your belt might take a hit so walk it off in lovely Seattle and head over to the sculpture garden on a sunny day or take first Avenue if it is cloudy. By first Avenue I mean just walking through Belltown. Lovely.

Fluffy biscuits, endless grits, and hot sausages. Prices aren't too bad. Portions are big. Overall: a good spot for some hot comfort food and coffee. I would recommend more as a grab-and-go because it really doesn't have that much seating."

But I guess that's what happens when you go to places that are #trendy, right? Lol. Anyway , the food's pretty good! Not exactly sure if they're 100% worth the wait, but I'm happy I tried it at least once. I got the Straight Up Bitch (with vegetarian gravy because I'm on a ""diet"") and it was delicious!

Dear I say that they are better than my dear departed Nana's, yes they are. I have not had a biscuit and sausage sandwich this good in a very long time. This was my first time eating here but definitely not my last."
Biscuit Bitch,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/biscuit-bitch-seattle?not_recommended_start=130,Kenneth P.,4.0,9/19/2016,7,WA,Not as tasty if delivered. Better if you eat it on the spot. Overall good food.

So if you can make it to the Belltown location might be a little bit easier. A lot of calories, but hey you're on vacation so why not indulge? The coffee is good too. Way better than Starbucks. And the staff has fun attitude. Be careful to check the hours before you go. They close early."
Biscuit Bitch,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/biscuit-bitch-seattle?not_recommended_start=130,Julie M.,4.0,8/27/2016,18,WA,"Stumbled upon this small spot one morning in search of breakfast. It was really crowded and had a long line but I decided to brave it. They have a small, eclectic menu. I had a biscuit sandwich because it seemed the obvious choice for a first-timer. The biscuit was great but had a little too much of the special house sauce. I'll prob skip the sauce altogether next time. I've heard if you go at off times that the line is shorter too."
Biscuit Bitch,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/biscuit-bitch-seattle?not_recommended_start=130,James A.,4.0,8/18/2016,3,WA,First time here. I saw them on Facebook and the name got my attention. In and out without any problems. Tasty!

I don't know if I would be eating this type of food all the time. It was a bit greasy and had lots of calories but I think once is okay to try. The place had a different atmosphere than I'm used to but it was okay overall. The food was decent. My friend recommended this place and I was a bit doubtful because of the name but I think everyone should try it once and experience it.

There's gravy and grits and sausage and it's almost overwhelming, but not quite. If you're thirsty, be ready for tiny shots of water though.

Its a hipster type of a resturant. Food is pretty good. Wide variety of things to choose from. One thing I didnt like was how packed it was and there is no place for you to sit down and eat. You have to go down the block to go eat. Id come back again.

Despite their lack of indoor seating, ordering online and picking up at the door was a breeze. The long line outside was a testament to what was awaiting inside.We tried the hot mess bitch - and oh boy, it did not disappoint. The smothering of gravy was just the way I like it, and the portion size was more than enough for my wife and I to share. We were full before we even finished the whole thing!The staff, while unconventional, were an absolute delight. Expect a good-hearted cuss word or two, adding a unique and fun touch to the morning atmosphere. There's nothing quite like being talked dirty to in the early hours - it certainly set the tone for a fantastic day. We'll definitely be back for more."

I had the vegetarian sandwich option which comes with a Morningstar sausage. I will say I wish they had more options for customization. I prefer to eat egg whites, but there are no sub options. Also, all orders are done online. They have a sign outside of the restaurant door which advises how long the wait is for food. There is no indoor sitting, but there a few tables located outdoors. I suggest for you to order online before you get there. You will receive a text and email when your order is ready."

I heard so much about this place and we kept seeing the long lines every morning. Biscuits Bitch gives you a great vulgar experience starting from the name all the way to picking up your food. Want to party at 8am? Come on in. Twerk music to get playing to get your day started. Everyone is so friendly however, ""bitchy"" (lol) at the same time. The top seller, Gritty Scrambled Cheesy Bitch, included biscuit and gravy, eggs, cheese, and grits. I added the country sausage to help make things a little more groovier. The prices vary depending on what you want or what you want to add. There is not a lot of space to eat. You literally have to stand and eat or claim your table fast (we got lucky). Get there early for a good spot! PS: When you check in on yelp, you get a free sticker (if you know me, you know I love stickers!). [Review 94 for 2019. Review 536 overall]"

Of course as soon as they open, there's a line out of the door, but it goes by pretty quick. I love how everything is super ""bitchy"" themed. This sass filled cafe has a variety of biscuit dish options.We ended up getting a Smokin' Hot Bitch, which is a biscuit and gravysmothered in cheese and topped with a Grilled Louisiana hot link, eggs and jalapenos. Since the plate already seemed heavy enough, I opted for no cheese. Everything was sinfully delicious and the portions were so huge that I just couldn't finish it. Overall, if you live by YOLO and don't mind an early onset of clogged arteries then definitely come to this spot :-D"

Even when there's a considerable wait, it's worth it. I recommend supporting this local business so they can hopefully grow to serve more patrons at a time.The food was so delicious. I ordered the Straigh-up bitch, and I was a little skeptical because I had never had gluten free anything. It was so tasty and it hit the spot just right. The customer service is some of the best I have experienced. They were so kind and family friendly. I think her name was Virginia, but she was super kind and it felt genuine. Will definitely go next time I am in Seattle. Overall, such a lovely atmosphere."

Good old fashioned southern-style cooking with modern twists (the vegetarian gravy option, made with shiitake mushrooms and smoked salt for example). The sausage gravy is rich and flavorful, and the biscuits have just the right balance between density and fluffiness. Take into account your other late night options (hot dogs) and Biscuit Bitch becomes the cream of the crop! And it looks like plenty of people agree: downtownseattle.komonews…"
Shaker + Spear,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/shaker-spear-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,D D.,1.0,10/25/2022,109,CA,"Never felt so discriminated in my life. This place is the absolute worst! Management you need to do better about your establishment! This place discriminates and for no reason We are visiting Seattle from SoCal. We are of Asian decent. Our family joining us were visiting Seattle for the first time. They are military and moving to Japan tomorrow. They are African American and they wanted to try Shaker + Spear as their last meal in America. We all walked in as you can see from outside that there were empty tables. We were a party of 6. The white hostess looked at us and basically said she doesn't have a table to accommodate us and that she won't have any for the rest of the night. My group consisted of 3 adults and 3 children. There was a table right in front of her that accommodated more than 6 people. She said I can recommend somewhere a bit more ""casual"". I didn't understand what she meant by that as we were just as casual as she was, along with other people in that restaurant. She then proceeds to call on another guy saying what's that one Mexican place that you recommend? The guy looked confused as he was like it's Italian. She then proceeds to name other places that we had no desire to eat at. We hear of this happening all the time to other people and today, this ignorant POS wanted to give us that experience. Does this establishment not accept kids? Is there a dress code to eat here?Do you have to be of a certain race to be allowed to eat here?Are we, as tourists, not allowed to dress casual in jeans, pea coats, and Nikes, to feel comfortable in the rainy Seattle weather as we are sightseeing? Is this attire just not acceptable to eat at this establishment?Do you just judge people as if we look like we can't afford to eat there? Whatever her ignorant reasons were, we all felt discriminated by this white chick. Then to top if off, as we were exiting, one of our kids was approached by another white ignorant idiot. My nephew had a boot on as he broke his leg in an accident. This idiot decides to ask my nephew hey kid what did you do to get that boot? Was it something stupid or smart? He's like there's only one right answer but I bet you that you did something stupid right?I was like wtf are you f-ing kidding me right now?! What kind of idiot talks like to this a child??!! Man this place sucks! F this POS racist place!"

The cook on the black cod was perfect though, and the flavors worked well together. Maybe they could add a puree of some type to make it more substantial."

Scotch Olives as appetizers, really no flavor. Wife had the braised short ribs and really like it, especially thought the sauce was very tasty.

I tried their Dungeness Crab and Shrimp along with the Steelhead. Each dish was a showcase of flavor and freshness - the seafood was cooked just right, bringing out its natural taste. The ambiance of the place adds a nice touch, creating a cozy yet upscale dining atmosphere. Service was attentive and friendly, adding to the overall positive experience. A solid four-star spot for seafood lovers!"
Shaker + Spear,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/shaker-spear-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Eric T.,4.0,11/2/2023,17,WA,"I visited this establishment for breakfast and opted for the shaker hangover, a dish featuring fried chicken perched atop a biscuit with gravy and crowned by a fried egg. It proved to be quite delightful. The biscuit had a rich, buttery taste, and the chicken was expertly fried. As you might expect, it's a hearty meal, and the name suits it perfectly.Securing a reservation for a 10 AM Saturday morning visit was a breeze, and it seemed like we could have easily walked in as well, as the restaurant was not overly crowded. The service we received was of good quality.While their breakfast menu is somewhat limited, I found myself intrigued by some of their seafood offerings, so I may return to explore the dinner options in the future."
Shaker + Spear,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/shaker-spear-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Riley J.,4.0,9/15/2023,5,WA,"Recently visited Shaker + Spear for both brunch and dinner on separate occasions. Tried a variety of dishes, and while everything was prepared well, I felt the flavors were standard for the price point. The ambiance is nice, and the service was attentive. It's a solid choice if you're in the Belltown area, though I was hoping for something a bit more unique in terms of taste. A respectable 4 stars for the overall experience."

Shaker + Spear,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/shaker-spear-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=10,Jessica P.,4.0,3/31/2019,302,IL,"Very good food. Slightly overpriced. It's inside of a hotel, so you're paying a ""we have you captive"" tax. We came here for brunch. I had the trout Spread and homemade crackers and my husband had the crab cake Benedict which features the cakes as the muffins. This is a great idea! Yum. He had a cappuccino which ran $6, and I had a $4 tea. Both were alright, but definitely not worth those costs. If you're charging $6 for coffee it better be something to write about and not in the way that I'm currently doing it. The trout was awesome. In a city with so many options, this was good, but not worth the rating it currently has. The service was great. Hosts and servers super accommodating. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could."

From the moment we walked in, the service was impeccable--attentive without being overbearing, and everyone made us feel right at home. We started with the octopus appetizer, and let me tell you--it was fantastic. Perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor, it had just the right balance of tenderness and char. Every bite was a delight. For our main course, we split the burger, and it did not disappoint. Juicy, perfectly seasoned, and accompanied by fresh toppings that elevated the dish. Even splitting it, we found it to be satisfying and well-portioned. The ambiance was also worth mentioning--modern yet cozy, with a great vibe that complements the stellar food and service. If you're in Seattle and looking for a spot with top-notch food and excellent service, Shaker + Spear should definitely be on your list. Highly recommend!"
Shaker + Spear,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/shaker-spear-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=10,Chopard J.,5.0,6/17/2024,9,WA,"After eyeing this seafood restaurant for a while, I finally decided to give it a try-and what a delightful experience it turned out to be! I don't typically indulge in seafood, but every bite tonight was a revelation. The cauliflower steak was simply delicious, and the roasted pepitas added a fantastic crunch that elevated the dish. Despite my usual preference for fully cooked salmon, I thoroughly enjoyed the medium rare preparation, which paired perfectly with the squash and pickled watermelon. As a side, the brussels sprouts were a tad spicier than expected, but the combination of flavors was absolutely amazing. Overall, I can't praise the dishes I enjoyed tonight enough; the flavor profiles were outstanding and truly memorable.The dining area is small, so I would recommend making reservations to ensure you get a table. This restaurant exceeded my expectations in every way, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit to explore more of their enticing menu."

Morgan, the floor supervisor was very attentive and friendly and made sure that all my requests had been taken care of. The food is really fresh and flavorful, most of it bought from local vendors.

The waitstaff were not attentive or friendly, and you were left feeling neglected and unimportant. It's important for any restaurant, particularly one that charges a premium price, to provide exceptional service to its customers.Firstly, the quality of the food provided was not up to your expectations. It's disappointing when you go to a barbecue restaurant and the meat isn't cooked to perfection or isn't of high quality. This is especially frustrating considering that you're paying a premium price for the food.Our experience at Ishoni Yakiniku was not a good one. The combination of mediocre food and poor service left you feeling dissatisfied and disappointed. While it's possible that others may have had a better experience, based on your own experience, it's hard to recommend this company to others."
Ishoni Yakiniku,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/ishoni-yakiniku-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Sharon T.,3.0,1/27/2023,55,CA,"I recently visited this restaurant and while it was a decent experience, it was not outstanding. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice. However, given the price I honestly expected better quality of meat.The food itself was good, but not exceptional. Overall, it was a decent experience, but not one I would rush to repeat. If you're looking for a Japanese BBQ, there are probably better options in the area."

Ishoni Yakiniku,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/ishoni-yakiniku-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Alec B.,4.0,9/19/2024,3,CA,Overall I think the food is good and for the promotional price it was worth it but the normal price might be too expensive for what we had.The meat was well seasoned and the variety was good. I think the cuttlefish was the standout option.The only really weird thing I noticed was that the set salad that was using Costco salad mix. The dressing was good but could have been better.
Ishoni Yakiniku,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/ishoni-yakiniku-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Alice W.,4.0,9/19/2024,1,WA,Food is great! I've been this place for a few times now. Dish I must order thick cut beef tongue and of course the signature truffle sandwich w wagyu beef! I would avoid the clam soup though. Not impressive at all.

The restaurant specializes in beef, and they really know how to do it right. The variety and quality of the cuts were impressive--from tender wagyu to flavorful short ribs, every bite was mouthwatering.The interactive experience of grilling your own meat at the table added a fun and engaging element to the meal, allowing us to cook the beef just how we like it. The marinated beef was packed with flavor, and the sauces provided complemented the meat perfectly.The atmosphere was lively but not too loud, which made it a perfect spot to enjoy with family.

Every table was full and it was very lively with music playing but not excessively loud.We each got their Flash Deal meal set (disclosure: posting a review entitles you to a discount on the set) as well as a Mentaiko seafood udon (limited 20 servings a day on Tues/Wed/Thurs) and they were both awesome. The set comes with a large variety of meats with beef, pork, and calamari as well as side dishes like rice, salad, and kimchi. The meat was all fresh and well marinated and tasted great. I recommend the udon if you're a fan of mentaiko and it's still available. The servers were really nice and came by multiple times to change our grill grate and fill our waters. They also helped us store a birthday cake in the fridge and gave us plates and a cake slicer to celebrate.The grill itself is somewhat small so it may get cramped at times for four people but that just gave us more time to eat and chat. Overall we had a great experience and will come back in the future :)"

When you walk in, you're greeted by a mariachi band playing ""Beethoven's 5th,"" because nothing says ""fiesta"" like classical music! You would be remiss to live life without trying the Vacio and asking for a side of flour tortillas with their unique salsa sampler. Cocktails leave a little to be desired.

We ordered Wylarah wagyu and Japanese A5 filet. They are the most expensive wagyu on the menu(not sure if there's any hidden menu for better choice) The meat is great. I saw from the review from others saying it's overcooked and IT IS! Luckily I ordered rare for the fillet and it's great! Try to order with one lower level of doneness. This restaurant is not for fine dining, smoky(from the steak cooking board) and noisy. Those are fine for me.One thing I dislike: the cooking board is very hot and cooking the meat so oil splash everywhere.... I have it on my clothes and my hands and arms... it last for like 5 minutes before we couldn't stand it and asked for a players remove the meat from the hot stone board."

Has oysters as app and they were perfect.Filet and lamb chops is what we got and both were as good as any steakhouse I have been.  I have been to many. The service made the place it was outstanding.  Only reason not 5 stars is slightly pricey.  But compared to other steakhouses it is a bit more reasonable. I can handle paying as long as it is good. This place was worth it.

Asadero Ballard,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/asadero-ballard-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,Josef S.,5.0,10/19/2023,27,NJ,"From the moment I walked into Asadero Ballard, I was met with the inviting aroma of grilled meat that immediately transported me to a world where culinary craftsmanship and tradition come together in harmony. The pièce de résistance of the night was, without a doubt, the ribeye steak.Every bite of the ribeye promised an explosion of flavors - a symphony of smokiness that was neither overpowering nor understated, perfectly complementing the inherent richness of the meat. The tantalizing smoky flavor, reminiscent of age-old grilling techniques, brought forth memories of rustic barbecues, and yet, it was served with an elegance that is befitting of a fine dining experience.Accompanying the steak was a baked potato that deserves its own accolade. Fluffy on the inside, with a crisped, golden exterior, it was the ideal counterpart to the hearty steak. It was as if the potato had been baked to perfection, capturing the essence of earthiness and comfort in every morsel."

Asadero Ballard,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/asadero-ballard-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Josh B.,5.0,8/25/2023,202,MI,"Overall, this Latin steakhouse provided a phenomenal dining experience. The cuts of meat were some of the best I have ever seen. The restaurant had a quaint outside setting, and we were seated right away. Our server, Samuel, was fantastic and attentive to our drink and food requests.To start, we ordered the guacamole, which was super fresh and served with crispy house-made tostadas and bread. The fire-roasted jalapeño stuffed with cheese and bacon was delicious, but the standout was the chorizo cheese dip, which was the best of the three appetizers.The salsa they provided was fantastic and had a spicy kick to it. It added an extra layer of flavor to the meal.Since there were seven of us, we decided to share the Australian Wagyu tomahawk and the World of Filet Wagyu, which included American Wagyu, full-blood Australian Wagyu, and Miyazaki Japanese A5. The combination of these different types of Wagyu beef couldn't get much better.As for the sides, the fire-roasted poblano peppers with corn were fantastic, and the charred broccoli was exceptional as well.We were so full from the main course that we decided not to order dessert, but overall, the dining experience at this Latin steakhouse was outstanding."

Party of 4 with drinks, appetizers and entrees (1 shared) was just over a hundred dollars. The service was good as was the food and left full and satisfied.

I had been your fan for a long time back from your beginning in Kent where most of your clientele was Mexicans and a few people knew about your great carne Asada tacos hence even back in those days they had only like 5 items .. all great though but i decided to visit your new location in Ballard , it was a nice experience it was like watching your kids go to college or something like that I don't have kids lol but that most be the feeling about seeing a business and grow up to bigger leagues , well on the food I tried the tenderloin tacos my friend got the already traditional carne Asada great as always service needs a little work , my check took longer than normal to get but it's all good it's a new restaurant and we understand that they have stuff to work out overall a great experience."

The weird thing is the location though the family that runs this place are super nice and friendly I don't know why they decided to expand to Ballard ? When most of their customers are Latinos looking for the real thing and not hipsters looking for trendy rip off places that sell organic water and weird stuff like that ... This is as real as it gets its like eating in a asadero from Hermosillo Sonora lovely ! The rib eye tacos cooked to order and the massive carne Asada they don't mess around with portions and we north Mexicans love that ! I just wish them the best in such a difficult location open a place where your people appreciate your food I just don't see them cutting it in Ballard but I still wish them a good business and will support them as much as we can but remember that it's us Norteños that love your food !!! .

Usually have a great experience. Whoever was the hostess tonight made me never want to return. I walk in at 10:25 to be seated and am told their kitchen closes at 10:30. Which is odd cause I've never been told this especially cause I only order oysters and a few drink around this time and day. Needless to say I won't be back.
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,emily c.,1.0,10/11/2023,1,WA,"I am still reeling from shock of how horribly myself and my family were treated. I, visibly pregnant, was seated at a table with a bench on one side and 2 chairs on the other. My 2yo and 5yo were both sitting with me on the bench side waiting for my husband to arrive. There were 3 other similar tables next to us, all still unseated. The hostess kindly brought us crayons for my children to color on the paper laid across the table. My daughter was coloring, never straying once from our table. My son was guardian of the crayons. On three occasions, my *near 2yo* screamed loudly ""MINE!"" when my daughter went for a crayon. I am well aware this is less than ideal. It is a phase he is in, screeching any time he is excited or mad or expressing emotions. Before and after each of those moments, he was calm and happy and just fine. Each time he did it, I did my best to get him to stop immediately. We had been there all but 10 minutes. The manager, Christopher Fischbach, approached me and said ""You are going to have to reign this in."" I asked ""excuse me?"" And he said ""you are going to have to reign this in. We can't have your children running around and the screaming will have to stop."" I replied that my daughter hadn't left the table once and then asked how he suggest I stop my not yet 2yo son from screaming?"" He said he didn't know. I asked ""and what if I can't? Will we be escorted out?"" And he said ""if it is excessive, maybe so. We have to seat these other tables.""At this point I was so incredulous, I could not believe this was being said to a paying customer, let alone the fact that a child was being targeted. I asked if this was routine for them, he did not reply and he walked away. I still cannot believe this happened. I am appalled. I am ashamed to say that we stayed, but I refuse to be bullied. Yeah, they got my money, but I have my dignity. And I hope Christopher (who, no, does not have children of his own) treats families trying their absolute best with the respect they deserve moving forward. He was a pretty massive disappointment to humanity tonight.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money here. The food was not remotely worth what they lack entirely in service."

As you've probably gathered, my partner is a transgender woman and I fully support/love her, we were eating at the Old Spaghetti Factory in Southcenter when my partner said she felt someone staring at her, I was going to assure her that kno one was staring, however, I was appalled to see this kid working there standing in the kitchen entrance pointing at her, I stared the kid down until he walked away. I immediately asked for the manager, the manager who came over to help us was completely drunk, he asked us if we were sure he was pointing at us, and he offered to pay for our food.

We arrived at 6:50 and were turned away saying that there is no space for us ( there was plenty of space as we could see) We were told there was a burlesque showing going on later in the evening in the back.

We enjoyed a very nice lunch for two, linguine vongole and the squid ink pasta seafood special.The awkward moment arrived when the server brought us an empty plate with two birthday candles absent of anything except the two candles.We felt as though he presented an ""empty"" birthday wish. I am still dumbfounded by the gesture. Honestly I would have preferred no recognition rather than the empty plate presentation. That was the one star reception we received.

The problem was the cost of the food for the quantity and quality. We really went to see the perfomace thinking it would be a fun way to spend dinner. Well the performace is five minutes at best, every 30-45 minutes so don't go for that. The food was way over priced. I spent $44.00 for a small bowl of (premade) gluten free pasta with a bland cream sauce, a butterscotch pudding (which was pretty good) and a glass of water-yes $44!!! . Since I had to eat GF I didn't get bread unless I wanted to pay $3 more for Udi's bread. There were no dinner salads, veggies, meat for my dish or anything else. I hate the Italian Denny's (Olive Garden) but have to say I have had better meals there and for a better price. Felt a bit duped by the allure of a cool performace which is the only reason I was willing to spend that kind of money on pasta only to find out it the performance wasn't really part of the ambiance.

The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=10,EmmLee W.,1.0,9/16/2013,8,WA,"We planned our meal two months in advance, reserved a table, and hoped to top off the last night of our Seattle vacation with an excellent view, meal and drinks.We were seated on the patio, jammed into a corner but jutting out into the walkway, where we were jostled by staff and other diners. We ordered sodas while taking a moment to look at the wine menu, and decided to share an order of the calamari with spinach. This was okay, a bit overcooked and chewy, but we had high hopes for the meal - I ordered linguine with clams, and my husband ordered clams and mussels.I had one bite of my pasta with clams, and couldn't eat anymore. The pasta was overcooked, but all of that was masked by the amount of sodium in the ""broth"" - you could taste nothing BUT salt, as though a cup of it had been poured into the cooking liquid. The acidity burned my tongue and scoured the inside of my mouth. I couldn't taste or eat properly for two days afterward. My husband's clams and mussels had no seasoning or taste, other than that of steamed and overcooked seafood. No garlic, wine, herbs or anything else. It was as if they'd steamed the shellfish and dumped them in the bowl. Also, no pasta or other sides were served with that dish: $26 or so for a bowl of flavorless steamed mussels and clams. We declined to order something else, and asked for our check. This was the only time in our lives that we've ever walked out of a restaurant. Although the manager comped our soda and calamari, we left a comparable amount on the table for the waitress and staff. We figured they shouldn't be left without the tip they'd have received had the chef and kitchen staff not put out such an embarassing ""meal"". We spent an hour trying to find another restaurant that was open in the area after 9 PM, which oddly enough is not easy to do, especially as we'd walked from our rental to The Pink Door.As far as ambience and staff: the greeter and our waitress were very nice. The place was okay, but other than some cute decoration and a good band, it wasn't exceptional - certainly not enough to balance out the mediocre starter and inedible meal. I can honestly say I'd not recommend this restaurant to anyone."

After reading the rave reviews, I was excited to check it out. I ordered the seasonal Love Fest drink and the spinach pasta lasagna. Both were absolutely delicious--the best lasagna and cocktail I've ever had. Despite it being pretty packed and not having a reservation, the host kindly offered me a seat at the bar. I didn't mind since I was dining solo. The bartender was very friendly and made me laugh as we chatted about San Francisco, my hometown. The ambiance was charming, with a dark yet cozy interior and live music, which was a lovely bonus.Fast forward to my second visit, which was during my birthday weekend on a solo trip to Seattle. I decided to have my birthday dinner at The Pink Door. Unfortunately, this experience was vastly different. I arrived around 8 PM, close to the last call for dinner, so the restaurant was quite empty. Despite this, the host insisted I sit at the bar again, which felt odd since there were plenty of empty tables and I wanted a more traditional dining experience for my birthday. I ordered an orange cocktail (can't remember the name), and while the waitress carded me, she didn't acknowledge my birthday at all. Additionally, my water cup was only refilled by a passing busser rather than my waitress, who seemed inattentive. The lasagna was just as delicious as before, but the service this time was extremely disappointing. It felt like they weren't interested in providing good service during the last call.The food at The Pink Door is amazing, but the service can be hit or miss. They definitely need to improve their service, especially for customers who dine during quieter times."

Our server and the overall service on the other hand was less than subpar and rude at times. I came here with my girlfriend knowing I was going to spend a few hundred dollars and we were taken to our seat and immediately told by our young male server that when he is in our presence we have to put our masks on which I am 100% on board with preventative measures regarding covid however when im in a restaurant sat across from one person while our server is 6ft apart it didn't make sense but we went with it. Putting his unapproachable attitude to one side, we literally had to wait close to 20 minutes to even order our first drink which again showed either his lack of understanding in the customer service industry or lack of respect to his patrons. I know he isn't a true representation of this establishment because of the many other great reviews but when youre spending hundred of dollars on a meal, the environment and service should be a solid part of the package and this was lacking. I have been to nearly 8 restaurants over my vacation here in Seattle and this guy ruined what would be an amazing 5 star place. Would not recommend to friends or family."

My wife and I were really looking forward to going and we thought it was a bit of a classy place, judging by the website. Turns out, it's not. Luckily for us, we got to sit inside, but the tables outside all had plastic picnic type table cloths. The restaurant is located in an alley and it fits in with the Public Market scene, but definitely not with the classy scene that it portrays on the website. The food wasn't that great either, ESPECIALLY for the price we paid. I had the spaghetti, which came with no garlic bread or anything and my wife had the steak, which was more bone than actual meat. The main reason we wanted to go was for the trapeze artist, which was supposed to be performing from 6:30-9PM, so I made our reservation for 6:30PM. The whole hour and a half that we were there, she performed for 2 songs. That's it! The trapeze artist isn't something that should be advertised if she isn't going to perform. Overall, I definitely won't be returning to The Pink Door. It's just not worth the money. It's nothing spectacular."

While my experience had its highlights, there were a few aspects that left me wanting more.Let's start with the positives. The service at The Pink Door was exemplary. From the moment I stepped through the pink-hued entrance, the staff greeted me with warm smiles and made me feel welcome. They were attentive, knowledgeable, and ensured that my dining experience was smooth and enjoyable. Kudos to the staff for their exceptional service!The drink selection at The Pink Door was a true delight. The bar is well-stocked and the mixologists behind it know their craft. I tried a couple of their signature cocktails, and each one was expertly crafted, bursting with unique flavors and beautifully presented. If you're a fan of creative libations, The Pink Door will not disappoint.Now, onto the food. While the dishes at The Pink Door were undeniably well-prepared, I found them to be on the pricier side. It's true that quality ingredients and a skilled culinary team come at a cost, but I couldn't help but feel that the prices were a tad steep for what was served.Specifically, the pasta, often hailed as an Italian staple, left me somewhat underwhelmed. While it was cooked to a perfect al dente texture, the flavors fell slightly short of my expectations. The dishes lacked that extra oomph that elevates a good pasta to a memorable one. Perhaps a bit more attention to seasoning and innovative flavor combinations would enhance the overall dining experience.Despite these shortcomings, The Pink Door does possess its fair share of merits. The attentive service and the remarkable drinks are definite highlights that shouldn't be overlooked. However, I would encourage the restaurant to refine their flavors and consider adjusting their pricing to offer better value for the culinary experience they aim to provide.In summary, The Pink Door is a decent Italian restaurant with good service and amazing drinks. While the food may be a bit expensive and the pasta lacks a little bit of flavor, it's still a place worth visiting if you're in the mood for a charming atmosphere and attentive service."

The interior is fun and whimsical.The reception we received at the front desk was lukewarm. Our server seemed to be having a bad day. Not bad service, just no warmth or personality. The cocktails were on the lower end of OK. The food was good, not great. The whole thing was just OK. I think if the hostess had seemed happy we were there, it would have started us on a better track. We wouldn't go back, but I guess it's worth one visit."

Hidden in an alley near Pike Market and only identifiable by their signature pink door, this restaurant feels like stepping into an old vaudeville theater. When we went, there was a live band with an amazing vocalist playing blues/Americana music. The pasta was good but the dishes could've used more sauce that was a consensus from all. The prices are affordable that's for sure. We stayed for a few hours, enjoyed the food, atmosphere, jazz band and company. The service could've been quicker but the waitress was extremely nice and knowledgeable. There's no reason why I wouldn't go back."

We found it by chance and it really does have a nondescript pink door. But when you walk inside, you get the feeling of warmth, history and elegance. The food was fantastic and they easily accommodated my no grain eating challenges. Their house infused olive oil was out of this world. We had filet of sole and a butternut squash risotto with shrimp. Could not have been better. We wanted to keep eating because it was so good but were full! Wait staff was friendly and attentive. Live music was fun on a Saturday night. We will be back!"

The environment was so good with delicious aromas of foods spread all over. Our ordered food was served so well and it was so appealing to my taste buds. Our server was very friendly. He gave us the details of all the dishes and so it was easy to decide then.

Had the lobster ravioli and the eggplant pasta for course. The administration was brisk, the server helped us pick sustenance. We finished supper on olive oil cake with orange and pomegranate sauce - it was immaculate! Provincial old fashioned feel, the unrecorded music after some time just develops the air! PS: Ask for the seat by the window, you may very well get it as we did ! :)"

These are pretty rare, but it's definitely worth spending one on the Pink Door's elevated patio. In fact, make an evening of it by putting on that swooshy little dress you paid too much for and a spritz of expensive perfume. I love their wild mushroom risotto and they make a damn good caesar too. Of course you will enjoy a glass of wine or other pretty drink, and your companion will find you enchanting."

The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=150,Justin S.,4.0,3/3/2018,9,WA,"Got a gift card for a present, so the wifey and I checked it out on a Sunday to see the trapeze artist. Good show in great ambience, the space is awesome and unique. The food was good but nothing special compared to the hundreds of other Italian places in town. Since it's been over a month ago, I can't even remember what we ordered, which means while it was good it also isn't especially rememberable. Still, you should go check out this historic Seattle restaurant. You won't be disappointed and is you go on a show night all the better."

Recently they relocated their kitchen or rather renovated their kitchen and I think that certainly helps. Friday night spot on fun.

The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=160,Shay L.,4.0,11/1/2017,7,WA,One of most vintage and collectively put together restaurants I have been to in Seattle. The simple but elegant aesthetic adds a nice touch to the vibe and provided my time there with relaxing energy. I indulged in the spaghetti with meatballs and enjoyed the simplicity in the flavors.Everything blended well and gave my palled a sweet but organic dance. The pricing is far and if you have dessert you're only coming out of your pocket about 40$. HIGHLY recommended!!!!

We started with the cheeseboard and it was the perfect start to the meal. I had the Linguine alle Vongole and the clams were so fresh it was one of the best linguine's I've had.

Small jazz band trio was play on a Tuesday night. Loved the food and creative drink menu. We went back on another night since we liked this place so much.

I came here and had the grilled Caesar salad and it's hands down the most delicious plate I've ever had. It was so good I couldn't even wait to take a picture. I also ordered the tuna tartare and shared the red sauce pasta! I'm so pleased with the quality of the food here. We also bought a bottle of Sangiovese and it was on point.

I eagerly asked our waitress for more bread so I can lap it all up. My girlfriend ordered the risotto which was so craftily made and had such exquisite flavor and wasn't overcooked nor undercooked but just right. For dessert we got the apricot and strawberry crumble which was too sweet, but thank god we had some ice cream to tone it down."

Traveled here with some friends and this place was recommended by the hotel concierge and once we got there we knew why. Excellent selection and the bartenders knew what they were doing.

I 'd been here once before, and had an excellent experience, so I convinced the group to check it out. As before, there was an accordion group, which totally rocked (we lucked out and got a table close to the stage). I went with the chilly dungeness crab dish, and between the four of us, we killed two bottles of wine, and totally enjoyed ourselves. Everyone adored their plates too, and the desserts were divine. Highly recommended."

Undoubtedly one of these areas which makes you feel as if you have finally found the city and broken out of the tourist routine, regardless of the closeness to Pike's Place I could not decide between 4 and 5 stars, but it gets five to counter all the whinging."

Decent views of the water and downtown.They have some vegan options here, which was a nice surprise (I am not Vegas but when going with friends). I am a big fan of the puttanesca.I have only seen the ""show"" once, and it was entertaining but the real star is the food.Its called the Pink door because, other than the pink door, you wouldn't know how to find the joint.The bar across the alley was a great place to go after to continue the celebrations. I am drawing a blank on the name."

Plus knowing it was more of a pub it sort of threw the feel off. All the art on the walls and building was a please surprise and was excited about the whole place.The lasagna was fantastic and given the reviews from everyone else it's no suprise as well. Lasagna with some tabasco sauce makes it even better. Especailly with some heat makes the pallet just open up to bring the favor in that much more.

It was my birthday and my friends wanted something different than the usual so we tried it. Overall the food was good, all of our different wines were wonderful and we liked the atmosphere. We went on a Saturday evening so were able to watch the trapeze act. I'm told that they have 3 different trapeze acts a night but we only saw the first one. A little disappointing but still a unique experience. On Sundays they have a Vaudeville type of show that we haven't seen and may go back for that sometime. One note to others who have not been....there is no sign to indicate where the restaurant is outside. You enter from Post Alley and you must look for a kinda pink door to enter the Pink Door. Guess we should have read the yelp reviews before going :)"

The entertainment can be fun. Their appetizers tend to be on the spot. They have nice hours (good for people who work late and whatnot).Pink Door has been a consistently good spot. The particular highlights have been the pasta and the appetizers. Their pappardelle ragu is great! Most often Pink Door has been delivered via Postmates. It's one of the most solid bets for Italian we've found for delivery."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=190,Crystal N.,4.0,9/9/2015,187,CA,"It's been two months since my friends and I visited The Pink Door and my mouth is still watering whenever I think about how amazing the pesto lasagna was. I never thought a simple looking dish could taste that incredible. It's a must-order. The calamari was excellent as well. We assumed it was the usual deep fried dish but it wasn't. It was a nicely sauteed dish with garlic, tomatoes, spinach and white wine. When you enter through the pink door, you'll be mesmerized by how pretty the place is. It's an ambiance I'd imagine my reception to have if I had a small wedding party. The setting was whimsical, elegant and romantic.The back part of the restaurant has a more laid-back feel and is also where the bar is located! There's also an outdoor seating area - perfect to enjoy a meal with your S/O or friends."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=190,Aj G.,4.0,7/24/2015,6,CA,"You Gotta Go Once... this is one of those places that is the complete experience. Right from the start, the whole idea that there is no sign, just a pink door on an alley, gets you in the theme. It's not that hard to find if you pay attention, and look over the wall and see all the people dining on the deck that hangs over the water with an amazing view. Once inside, it's got that old Seattle brothel décor, and if you time it right, a trapeze artist twirling around for her 5 minute performance every 30 minutes. If you book online, it's for seating outside. We were there during a rare heatwave, so outside at night was great. Perfect view of the water, the Great Wheel, and a cool statue on the neighbor's balcony next door.The service was good, friendly, attentive, informative. The food was tasty, but my two teenaged sons reported it was not enough food. They both ordered the Pappardelle, which was only that on a plate. I ordered a really juicy piece of freshly caught king salmon, and my husband ordered cioppino. My plate was the tastiest, simple and fresh. The cioppino was good, but neither a brothy soup or a plated dinner, it was somewhere in between.If you somehow book a table inside, it's more crowded, intimate, and entertaining for sure. On Saturdays they have a cabaret show, which is separate from the meal."

Their Cesar sounds so simple but its so good either add the shrimp or the crab. We tried the fish of the day and cioppino. Let me just say Seattle gets down with their see food. This place is always busy and they have live music almost everyday of the week. The entrance in an alley way so its fun to find. Close to Pike Market and Downtown. Very Romantic and from now on will make it a point to dine here every time I come to Seattle."

The menu could of have a few more options, however all the food was good quality. I will for sure take my wife back in the summer for the out door seating our waiter mentioned to us.

Everything was great. But I got the lasagna which was delicious but small and I was still hungry after. The rigatoni with mamas meatballs was delicious but more on the Al dente side than we wanted. The meatball I thought it was just ok. But it's a popular dish. And the rose hips to my lips was really sweet but tasty.

Pink Door impresses with its thoughtfully crafted dishes and inviting atmosphere. The Ahi Tuna Crudo was fresh and bright and was complemented by fried capers and microgreens, creating a balanced plate with delightful textures and flavors. The Lasagna Pink Door, rich with spinach and perfectly melted cheese, exceeded my expectations despite not being a huge lasagna fan. The Lemon Risotto with Prawns had a bright, lemony taste that wasn't overpowering. The creamy risotto was decadent yet light, while the prawns were large, flavorful, and juicy. For dessert, the Tiramisu was creamy with soft, spongey ladyfingers and a pleasant coffee taste. The Espresso Martini, though smooth and potent, left me wishing for a creamier texture, but that's personal preference. Reservations can be hard to come by, but walk-ups are an option if you're willing to wait. The beautifully decorated interior and attentive, friendly service make Pink Door a charming spot worth the effort to visit."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=250,Eli T.,5.0,8/1/2024,152,CA,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Pink Door in Seattle, and it was an exceptional experience. Our waitress, Krista, did an excellent job recommending meals, appetizers, and drinks. She was attentive, ensuring our waters were always filled, which added to the overall positive experience.The ambiance was wonderfully relaxing, enhanced by a beautiful view of The Sound and West Seattle. The setting alone makes this place worth visiting.Now, onto the food. The lemon risotto is a must-try; it's perfectly balanced and flavorful. The crab and corn salad appetizer is another standout, bringing the freshness of Northwest crab right to your table. However, the oil served with the bread could be improved; it's a bit lacking for dipping six pieces of bread. A little more oil would go a long way.Despite this minor detail, Pink Door is a must-go destination. Just be sure to look for the huge line, as the entrance can be easy to miss.---"

The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=360,Phuong X.,5.0,4/4/2023,4,WA,"The ambiance here is the BEST! An old speakeasy (or so the story goes) turned restaurant. It's in an alley and there's no sign, just literally a pink door. You walk in and you're at the top of a staircase overlooking the restaurant. There's often live music and one time I saw an aerial artist performing during our dinner. The food is mostly Italian fare. I usually get a fish dish like Ahi tuna or halibut and a Caesar or kale salad. Having lived in Japan, I'm very picky about my fish, and the fish I've had here has always been fresh. Tables in the back have a great view of the water. On sunny summer days you can eat on the patio. I recommend for a romantic dinner, a business lunch or a gathering of adult friends or family."

We ordered two dishes, the Squid Ink Tonnarelli and the Lasagna Pink Door, and both were outstanding. The Squid Ink Tonnarelli was perfectly cooked and had a deliciously unique flavor. The pasta was infused with squid ink, which gave it a slightly briny taste that complemented the breadcrumbs in the dish. The Lasagna Pink Door was equally impressive. It was layered with rich, Bolognese sauce and creamy, making every bite melt in my mouth. We also ordered the Brussels sprouts side dish, which was a standout in its own right. The sprouts were roasted to perfection with a slightly crispy exterior, and the addition of bacon and balsamic vinegar added a wonderful depth of flavor. It was the perfect side dish to accompany our mains. To accompany our meal, we ordered the It Feels Right cocktail and The Pink Door mocktail, both of which were delicious and complemented our dishes perfectly. The It Feels Right cocktail was a refreshing blend of spirits and fruit juices, while The Pink Door mocktail was light and refreshing, making them the perfect complement to our rich and flavorful dishes.The atmosphere of the restaurant was charming and cozy, with the decor adding to the ambiance. Service was impeccable too - our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Overall, I highly recommend The Pink Door for a special dining experience. The food is exceptional, and the atmosphere is perfect for a romantic date or a night out with friends."

Everything we ordered was spot on. Here's a few we especially loved:1. Pink Door Caesar- this had fresh Dungeness Crab and their dressing was slightly different from the usual which we really loved! 2. Pink Door Lasagna- definitely not your typical lasagna - this one is vegan. The pasta layers are thinner than usual, probably using homemade pasta and we're living for those thin layers!! The flavors on here were also bomb. I just wished the pasta was a bit more al dente or firm but still, really good.3. Ahi Crudo- you really can't go wrong with fresh tuna!! We ended up dipping our bread in the sauce afterwards too cause it was so refreshing. Wish it came in a bigger serving for the price paid, but still good.4. White Chocolate Pound Cake Panini- it looks like a savory dish, but this actually makes use of pound cake as the slices with marshmallow and some crunchy things in between. This was my first time seeing dessert made this way, and I loved it. It was quite sweet though, so get this to share! 5. Squid Ink Tonnarelli- generous serving of pasta and shrimp! The pasta was perfectly al dente and the flavors were spot on.SERVICE: their servers were not very welcoming - they never smiled, never made small talk but they were very much efficient. Our glasses of water were never empty."

I love sitting on the patio and just having drinks with friends and enjoying the atmosphere. But you better get a reservation because they fill up quick and walk-ins are not always guaranteed. I definitely want to come back for when there's a show.

The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=580,Bill M.,5.0,10/23/2018,14,WA,"Got a reservation on a Thursday evening at 5:45 PM. We were seated immediately in the back room and decided on a bottle of The Dissident from the Mark Ryan Winery (priced at $65). It was delicious and an amazing red blend. Worth it - plus it was date night, so why not! We split the Caesar salad with fennel dusted croutons and it tasted amazing. We also got Mama's Meatballs which were delicious and was accompanied by a super flavorful marinara. For our main courses we both decided on their two specials. The NW Fish of the Day was a pan-seared halibut with black lentils, roasted carrots, and an arugula and shaved fennel salad. \The other special was squid ink pasta cioppino style with a spicy marina. IT WAS FANTASTIC. The noodles tasted fresh and soaked in all of the well-developed spicy sauce and the seafood was cooked perfectly. It was a bit pricey with the bottle of the wine and two appetizers, but it was well worth it and I will definitely be back again. Highly recommend it!"

It's a bit dark in there with the minimal lighting so it really feels like you're alone with you're party or significant other. My girlfriend brought me here the other day and we had a wonderful time enjoying the rosiotto pasta. There is entertainment as well which we didn't really expect even though she knew more about it than me. Our waiter was very helpful and knowledgable when picking wines for our dessert (which was also to die for). In conclusion I would highly recommend going here on a thursday night to get the full experience.

Its our wedding anniversary. I checked out a bunch of restaurants ahead of time and decided on The Pink Door due to it's combination of romantic decor, reasonable price and great food reviews.I was mildly worried about some of the comments regarding rude servers and such but figured it was still the best bet in town.After a long day running all over the Pike Place market, we arrived for dinner at 6:30. We were promptly seated and for the life of me can't remember our waiters name. He was extremely polite and had the specials down pat. I ended up ordering the spinach lasagna while my husband had the spaghetti and meatballs. Our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and we began to enjoy our meal.After just a few bites, a busser working near our table dropped a water glass which shattered all over the floor. As far as we could tell, none of it hit us or the table next to us so we continued our meal. Almost immediately another female employee came up and asked us if we were ok and if any glass had gotten in our food. We told her that it didn't but she insisted on having the food remade just in case. We told her we understood and she removed the old food. Our waiter showed up at the same time and was also concerned about our welfare.A short while later our new food arrived and everything was great. When we went to pay, our waiter brought the check and explained that both our entrees were on the house due to the accident. I told him that wasn't necessary but was greatly appreciated.I just wanted to say a special thanks to all the employees who helped us for making a memorable anniversary. We will definitely be back to The Pink Door on our next anniversary..."

I discovered it four years ago when looking for a good Italian place near work (I was at Macy's at the time) and found this place on yelp. I called ahead and they weren't busy so I thought I would stop by. Boy was I impressed. To this day, not even a home cooked lasagna by mom could satisfy my craving for what they make. Since that day I have taken friends who all have loved the food and service, and have come alone. I find the patio to be a wonderful place to enjoy a nice glass of wine and a good book. I also promised myself that night that someday I would have a boyfriend who would take me there on a date. We've been together for two years now, have a five month old daughter, and are now engaged. And he and I have been there together twice now."

All in all, this was the top seller among the many Biang Biang-style noodle joints across the country.(original)The service was quick and good, but the food left much to be desired. The dry mix mala noodle turns out to be lukewarm water, and it is called ""mala"" and spoken. The popcorn chicken was served with martyr's heads...

While the wait time after ordering was a bit lengthy, clocking in at 25 minutes for a bowl of noodles, the taste was okay, though not particularly surprising. Unfortunately, the Popcorn Chicken didn't live up to expectations; it's definitely not recommended as it didn't taste like it was supposed to.To add to the disappointments, my Mike tea never arrived, but the server promptly addressed it by removing it from the bill. Getting water refilled proved challenging, possibly due to a busy time and a shortage of servers during the shift. Despite these drawbacks, the server's attentiveness in handling issues and the acceptable noodle taste make me consider giving Biang Biang Noodle another chance, hoping for improvements. Three stars for now."

The service was impressively fast - my order arrived almost as soon as I sat down, which was great! The pork options, especially in the noodles, were really flavorful and tender, adding a nice savory depth to the dish.The soup, though, could have used a bit more kick. I was hoping for a little more spice to balance the richness of the broth. And while the noodles were delicious and freshly made, the prices felt a bit on the higher side for a casual spot. Still, Biang Biang left me satisfied, and I'd happily return for another round - maybe next time I'll ask for extra spice!"

They are delightfully chewy, clearly hand-pulled, and fresh. The mala flavor is executed perfectly, making these dishes truly outstanding. While I would pass on the dumplings, I personally lean towards the soup dishes over the dry ones, as the latter can sometimes be a bit too dry. Nonetheless, it's quite a challenge to find a noodle place with a better texture than this."

The place was bustling, with only two servers handling the crowd. I had to wait between 5 to 10 minutes before being seated. Having done my research, I promptly ordered the Mala Spicy Beef Dry Mix, a popular choice among Yelpers. Biang Biang specializes in hand-pulled noodles, known as lamian in Chinese. These noodles are made by repeatedly stretching and folding a piece of soft wheat dough to align the gluten and warm it up. The dough is then rolled out to a workable thickness and cut into portions.The food arrived quickly. Despite being called ""dry,"" the dish wasn't completely dry like Hakka noodles, which is something to keep in mind if you're new to the restaurant. Unlike some Chinese/Vietnamese dishes that might include broth with animal bone marrow or blood, this dry order didn't contain any such elements.The Mala Spicy Beef Dry Mix was delicious and perfectly spiced (I ordered medium spicy). The portion was generous. Despite needing to ask for a fork (I know, sacrilege), I wasted no time digging in.The table service was adequate but not proactive. I had to flag down my server once for the fork and later for a glass of water, both of which were brought promptly.Finding parking in the area can be difficult and expensive. It cost me $6 for an hour of street parking several blocks away from the restaurant.The seating area is not huge, but the tables more closely spaced than in a traditional American restaurant. There appeared to be a flight of stairs leading to an upper level, but I didn't see anyone using it.The prices are competitive, reflecting Seattle's pricey food scene. Overall, I'd not hesitate to return."

The noodles are simply out of this world - each bite was a perfect blend of flavors, textures, and the kind of homemade quality you can't find just anywhere.The drink selection was equally impressive.

I picked the curry dry and loved the flavor. Three of us ordered our own bowls which was a massive amount of food. Next time, I think we will share. We tried the green onion pancake and popcorn chicken. The highlights were the noodle dishes so I'll just stick with those.

I wasn't sure what to order and what the different noodle styles meant. The customer service was great as the cashier explained the different option and the style of the restaurant. It looks really nice. I ordered the cumin lamb dry mix and a crispy chicken bao. My order was done in the time frame I had been given, about 15 minutes. I also really liked how there were chairs outside the restaurant for me to sit and wait since not many places have that right now. The lamb lamb was well portioned and was very flavorful. The crispy chicken boa was delicious. I really enjoyed my experience and will be trying something new off their menu next time I'm in Cap Hill."

I came here one night and knew I had to get the spicy jumbo wings, they good, but just drenched in fish sauce and it was just so heavily breaded that it wasn't much meat underneath. Now don't get me wrong, I can handle my fish suave being that I'm Vietnamese, but this was just too much for me. We also got the shrimp paste grilled on lemongrass stalks and that too was just way too over powering and made it almost too bitter to eat. Over all the decorations were fun and interesting to look at. The cocktails were mediocre. And the wait is always so long, there are better Thai restaurants in the area with no wait and food you can actually enjoy."

Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Patricia A.,4.0,6/25/2023,44,TX,"Nue offers incredibly flavorful food that will leave your taste buds satisfied. However, one major challenge is finding parking in the area. With only parallel parking spots available, and very few at that, it can be a frustrating experience. Another aspect to note is the communal dining setup, where you may find yourself sharing a table with multiple parties, leaving little elbow room. This can make it difficult to fully enjoy the delicious food without being cautious of bumping into other patrons or accidentally knocking something over. That being said, the fried chicken wings are a standout item on the menu, with a delightful fish sauce that adds an extra layer of flavor. On the other hand, the Vietnamese iced coffee may be a bit too sweet for some tastes. While the portions at Nue are satisfying, it's worth mentioning that the menu prices are on the higher side for the area and ambiance. Lastly, the staff's service is decent, but nothing particularly noteworthy."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Linda R.,4.0,1/17/2023,11,WA,"Great place! Went back home to visit for thanksgiving this past year, and was so grateful of how convenient it was to make reservations (through Yelp). You absolutely have to have their fried rice. I am Filipino myself, and their fried rice is amazing."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Victoria S.,4.0,1/16/2023,5,WA,"A eclectic restaurant is a gem in Seattle. They have food from all over the world and even some wacky Thai Water Beetles! Not for me but my friends have them a try and stated they were simply salty. The cocktails weren't that great: the food the strong-suite of this place in my opinion. I couldn't really taste the lime or star anise in my drink, it was just like spiked pineapple juice."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Latashia W.,4.0,1/13/2023,6,WA,"I love the diversity of foods on the menu. The tosilog and the shakshuka were so good! Your receipt is brought to you in traveling books. Found that cool too. It sucks that they no longer do bottomless brunch. I personally don't like how the OJ is pre-mixed in the champagne. However, the experience was still great."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Lorraine S.,4.0,1/6/2023,11,WA,It's like a study abroad themed restaurant. I actually wanted to dislike this place but the food is excellent. I always get the Bunny Chow. Its one of my favorite dishes anywhere in Seattle. Good drinks too.
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Marc B.,4.0,9/22/2022,49,WA,"Lovely atmosphere and a good place in an area full of life. We really appreciated the food. The two starters were fantastic!The goat curry was missing a bit of salt, I think. But it can happen when cooking constantly, and it is subjective taste. Very easy to resolve. Service was quick. Most of the staff was friendly and polite. Very positive experience."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Sammy B.,4.0,9/12/2022,55,WA,We came here to celebrate my birthday some month ago and we were not disappointed. Delicious and fresh tapas as it can get. Delicious that is all. It gets busy pretty quickly at dinner time but overall the crowd is well managed for a comfortable seafood fest with your companionsFour stars just because I found it a bit overpriced.
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Hao Z.,4.0,9/1/2022,3,WI,Very thing taste good. The fry chicken wings is definitely not chengdu but they are good.

Their Chengdu fried chicken and Jamaican Jerk are out of this-world delicious!"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Erica C.,4.0,7/6/2022,5,WA,This place is great to go with a few people as you can share everything and portions are big.It was just two of us and we ordered 3 dishes but there were so many more items on the menu and being served that looked amazing. Highly recommend the chicken wings and South African Bunny Chow!Went back again last week.Tried their ribs which were fantastic along with the usual suspects but finished the meal with their coconut cake which was marvelous. Love this place !

It's our first time here, and we're confused about what to order. There's a lot to choose from on the menu! The area was clean and packed with people around 7 pm, and we waited for a while to be seated.Their menu consists of food from other countries. The ambiance was unique, and the wall decorations were beautiful and trendy! It catches your attention, and they also have good drinks selections!We will be back soon! Thank you!"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,sasha w.,4.0,6/13/2021,3,WA,Our order arrived 5 minutes before quoted time in less than an hour of order placed. So convenient and will definitely use again. Good job. Will be calling again real soon. However consider creating a website or an app that will make contacting you guys much more convenient as compared to calling in order to place an order. An app will go in getting more customers for the premises since the app will be available on several platforms and hence easy for the people to download it. Similarly a website will help to advertise the business as well as the services that are offered as well as any other information that might be considered relevant to the customer.

It's a decent spot to sit outside on a pleasant day or inside on a stormy one, attempting one of the yummy mixed drinks from the menu. The proposal is the Sunny Bunny for early lunch or the Bunny Chow for supper."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Maryam O.,4.0,3/25/2019,5,WA,This place was so fetch.

Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,Taylor B.,5.0,1/31/2024,15,WA,"Our initial experience at NUE was fantastic. The diverse menu offered a culinary journey through various flavors. I couldn't help but smile when I spotted Tocilog on their menu, and naturally, I had to order it.The Filipino Tocilog was accompanied by a delightful dipping sauce. The tocino slices were tender, and the egg was perfectly fried to a crisp. The Israeli Shakshuka was expertly cooked and seasoned. Lastly, the Tower of Chengdu Wings provided a satisfying crunch and a hint of spice. The distinct flavors of fish sauce, lime, and peppercorn were unmistakable. The presentation was impressive. All of this was complemented by a glass of ""Less Mosa.""The ambiance of the place is cozy and eclectic, and the service was outstanding. Without a doubt, NUE is a restaurant I'd consider for brunch or dinner when in Capitol Hill."

Von's 1000 Spirits is an American restaurant with an all scratch kitchen specializing in Seattle Sourdough & the largest collection of fine spirits in the cityWe each ordered a burger and were highly impressed. The bun was soft and fluffy, patties homemade, and reminded me of mom & pop shop burgers I would eat as a kid in Pasadena (Lucky Burgers, anyone?) The waiters were all extremely nice and the place was packed! However the vibe still felt intimate. Here are the two types of sandwiches we orderedDouble Smashed American Burger - two prime beef patties, American cheese, caramelized onions, packed dills, lettuce, and some magical sauce"

It's my go to answer whenever anyone asks me where I want to eat. It's also a great date spot. ;)The flavors here are incredible. I can't get enough of the hummus, kale & carrot salad, fresh potato frites, and roti. I generally don't like brussels sprouts but they're my favorite item on Nue's menu. I usually ask them to bring out the pineapple cornbread near the end since it's best when warm, and all their desserts are delicious too."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,Helen J.,5.0,9/9/2022,9,WA,"This restaurant lives up to the eclectic vibe. It's unique in every aspect. Their take on fried chicken is like none you've ever had. The barbecue ribs are a must, slow-cooked to perfection. The meat fell off the bone with every bite. All in all, it was a solid experience."

Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=50,Kelly G.,5.0,8/14/2019,7,WA,Awesome food in an environment that transports you to another continent. Delicious and creative without being weird or over self indulgent.
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=50,Heather D.,5.0,8/14/2019,2,WA,"Inventive food. Warm, community-creating environment. Honest, work-their-a**es-off owners and staff. One of my favorite Nue memories has been joining their One-World dinner featuring Syria. Not only were we exposed to delicious food (which, of course, we'd never tried before), but we dined with several Syrians, many of whom were recent refugees. It felt more like someone's home than a restaurant. Thanks, Nue, for enabling me to break (damn good) bread with people I never would have otherwise had the chance to meet."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=50,Phi N.,5.0,8/14/2019,2,GA,"Nue is hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle.

Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Elizabeth S.,5.0,8/14/2019,3,WA,"Nue is a unique restaurant in Seattle, and it's worth a trip to Capitol Hill from the 'burbs if you haven't already tried it. It's a small, locally-owned business and the owners travel the world to find new and delicious international street food dishes for their menu, so there's often something new to discover. I'm not an adventurous eater but my husband is, and there's always something there for both of us.The dining room is an intimate setting with decor sourced from all over. Great date-night place in a classy, relaxed setting with international flair. It's also been fun to see it featured on several food TV shows!"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Jannavie C.,5.0,8/14/2019,8,WA,This place has such a great variety of food from all cultures! I recommend doing family style so that you can try a bunch of different things because everything is delicious! Don't forget to get the tower of wings!!!
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Naveen J.,5.0,6/9/2019,6,IN,One of the few restaurants where you will not be disappointed when you are adventurous
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,K L.,5.0,5/24/2019,15,WA,"Even though one of the things I tasted was a giant bug, this is one of the best places to eat in Seattle! It's like taking a round-the-world tour with someone who's crazy about food. The laphet toke and the Chengdu wings remain favorites of ours. The UN skewers were awesome, especially accompanied by the pineapple cornbread. Their house made ice creams are mind blowing too. The water bugs...well, there was a crazy story that goes along with them, that we were lucky enough to hear firsthand from Chris."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Dave B.,5.0,5/13/2019,1,WA,"I've dined now at Nue twice, and was floored by everything I tried. Having been to many of the countries represented on the menu, I was ready to be disappointed but was impressed by the combination of authenticity and creative spin placed on the food. While I agree it helps to be adventurous (part of the fun eating here), the food is surprisingly accessible. Somewhat randomly, I ended up on a rafting trip on a 4 day rafting trip with Chris Cvetkovich, who owns Nue along with his wife Uyen. We somehow conned Chris to cook for us the entire trip - it was incredible to see him come up with exquisite meals riverside, often improvising with random ingredients from various coolers. More impressive was hearing Chris talk passionately about the people, places, and food he has encountered across the world. Inspiring. I'll be heading back to Nue for the food, but will enjoy it in a new light after spending time with Chris"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Jason W.,5.0,5/9/2019,7,WA,"I don't eat a lot of meat but when I have a fried chicken craving this is the spot for the best wings I have ever had. The presentation on the wings is awe-striking as you are served a massive tower of perfectly golden brown wings. The wings have the perfect amount of flavor and a mouth watering crunch when you bite into them. If you're looking for a lighter accompaniment to your wings, the Brussel sprouts with coconut are delightful. The negative to the restaurant is it is smaller so it can feel cramped. I wish the tables were a little more spread out and there was better sound dampening. That said it's in Seattle, and I'm sure they've done they best they can in order to make a profit. I highly recommend this place as the top spot for wings in the state. Not only that but they also have a really unique menu with other delicious items."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Jasdip S.,5.0,4/28/2019,2,WA,Went for brunch and was blown away. Was absolutely delicious. Will come back again and again.

The whole vibe is just incredible. It's community seating and that was very different for us but we enjoyed it so much. Thanks for a bomb meal !"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Bill M.,5.0,11/4/2018,14,WA,"I was skeptical because I thought the menu looked like a mess. Nothing seemed connected to me, everything felt like it had a million ingredients. But the food was absolutely delicious. We had the mofongo, Brussels sprouts, and the Syrian kale salad, and pineapple cornbread, and all four were phenomenal. The seating is mostly communal and it's tiny and loud so don't expect ambiance. Other than that, it's fab!"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Carolyn W.,5.0,6/30/2018,13,CA,"Love this place, go hungry be sure to get the chicken wings!"

It is highly unlikely that you have eaten anything that is on the menu. Come willing to try new things. We suggest ordering multiple items and sharing them family style."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Abakum M.,5.0,5/26/2018,3,CA,"My wife and I came to Nue for dinner on Monday night and had our minds blown. The food was so good! We were dying at each bite, gobbling things up, and so happily full afterwards. Our waiter was so attentive and kind! He kept our water refilled, gave excellent suggestions, and had this kind, friendly air that made it seem like he genuinely cared about our experience. It is so hard to find that kind of warmth in restaurants these days and we were super impressed. I cannot wait for the next time I go to Nue, so that I can try their lunch menu.I give Nue 5 stars because everything was great. When you walk in you get that small business family owned feeling and you just know they do their best to give you a great time."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Cheryl L.,5.0,5/3/2018,2,WA,"I was looking for a good breakfast place near my home. Found this on Yelp and it became our official breakfast diner! Went three morning in a row and enjoyed each on of them. The servings are large, the price reasonable and the service efficient. This is not gourmet fare but filling and quick. Line ups each morning but never waited more than 10 minutes. The servers were pleasant and responsive to requests and often constantly moving. Everything we ate was good!"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Gift H.,5.0,7/5/2017,13,WA,So good! The goat curry was so good. Must order McNguyen drink so so yummy! Will be back!

They are gracious and professional. I have the Cuban sandwich which was outstanding. The Mofongo was underwhelming. The communal dining was unexpected but kitschy. I plan to go back.
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Will P.,5.0,2/28/2017,4,WA,The goat curry is great! The Dutch pancakes are great! So many unique dishes!

Not an extensive menu, but a very diverse one that emulates international street food. I really enjoyed the Bunny Chow and Jamaican Jerk Chicken, along with the pineapple cornbread.

Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=80,Dave W.,5.0,8/14/2015,5,WA,"I'm not exactly what you'd call a ""Professional Yelper"" (this is my first review) but this was seriously the BEST meal I've had in years!I started with the Syrian Kale Salad and Tostilocos. The salad was dressed perfectly and the crunch of the toasted almonds and sweetness of the 'shattered dates' (I still need to figure out how they cut them so damn small) were the perfect textural and flavor counterbalance to the dressing.The Tostilocos were really cool and from what I was told, a pretty common Street Food in Mexico. They consisted of a bag of Mexican, Salsa Verde Tostitos, slit open and stuffed with all kinds of flavors and textures that just worked. Hot sauce, crunchy jicama and cucumber, Tamarind candy, nuts, pickled pork skins, etc. Super fun.I then, based on everyone's suggestions on Yelp, had the goat curry. This dish was over the top, or is it 'off the hook'? I can never keep up with these things. Anyway, super complex dish, just the perfect amount of spicy heat and the sweetness of the coconut cornbread on the side was the bomb (or is it the 'shit'?) I had the McNguyen cocktail which was Vietnamese coffee and Irish Jameson Whiskey shaken over ice. This was one of those drinks that could get a pass just for the clever name but OMG the flavor combo was amazeballs. I'd never tried Vietnamese coffee before, and now need to without whiskey, just to taste the pure flavor of it. After that I need to move back to the one with Jameson though because the combo was fantastic.......and I love whiskeyI was totally full by now but wanted to try their liquid nitrogen ice cream I'd heard about and ordered the French Toast and Bacon Flavor. Without going into too much detail let's just say I'm stopping by after work tomorrow just for another scoop.The service was fantastic and the decor super unique and kitschy but didn't feel contrived. I've been to a lot of bars and restaurants that just hang a couple of taxidermy pieces on the wall wearing hats and call it cool but this place definitely has its own character but still feels real (esp for Capitol Hill)I got a chance to chat a lot with one of the owners (he was my waiter) who mentioned that a lot of stuff on the menu changes all the time. Can't wait to come back and see what's new!!"

There were four of us that shared this wonderful food, starting off with unusual and very refreshing non-alcoholic drinks. Than we got down to the real event - beautiful food tastes from around the worlds starting off with what became one of my favorites, a yellow pea salad (Theng Manga Pattani Sundal) -nutty crunchy yellow peas served on grilled romaine and finished with lemon oil. Yum! We then slowly shared and array of dishes from the Grilled Barbados Pig tails that had crispy skin and tender juicy meat with a yummy dipping sauce, Jamacian Jerk Chicken that was tender, juicy and just exploding with flavor to the very satisfying sandwich-The Maracas Shark and Bake.  We ate slow and enjoyed each bite as it arrived one at a time. Great service and good tastes. that's as good as it gets."

Sexy atmosphere; candles everywhere. Good looking staff to compliment the interior design, but are they super unprofessional!! They were all ripping shots at the bar, including the manager! My waitress was beyond inebriated and slammed everything down that she gave us. Food was honestly good, except the mussels were past their prime. Crumbled inside of my mouth, so I had to spit it out. I expressed my opinion to the drunken waitress as she responded ""eew, gross"" and ran away. Manager came over to smooth things over, but he just made excuses instead of apologizing- probably thinking about his next shot choice. To make matters worse the FOH employees:A) all were talking about us- they're drunk so they can't control the volume of their voices, again the manager is ring leader in this conversation- so inappropriate and unprofessional. B) sent us out another mussel dish, but I was scarred from the first one so I turned it away.I guess I insulted the line cook? Table was in prime view of the kitchen so I could see him looking at the plate, running his mouth and then he gives me a nasty look. Word of advice to him: don't serve anything you wouldn't eat yourself and don't be in denial of when you send out shitty plates. Beautiful place, some dishes great and some sub par, but they need to pay attention to their daily operations, look at the management more and get a new service team before this place goes downhill! Sorry, just saying! I manage in casual fine dining and this behavior/treatment towards guests, I simply would not stand for."

I then asked how long it would take for a bowl of soup to come out so I could eat with them.

And the music was full of tunes that only could be handled with a scotch on the rocks. At 8 in the morning? NOT!Tonight it was two steaks, one so tough that it ruined what was a good flavor. But my wife's medium well steak came with the cow still mooing, and by the time they delivered the overly well done substitute back after we complained, appetite be gone. Evening ruined while she watched the rest of us eat our entries.

The waiting area is very small and most people (including ourselves) had to stand for the duration of our wait. The restaurant has a New Orleans Mardi Gras decor. We ordered scallops and a shrimp dish. Both were just OK. Our waitress wasn't very attentive, but the atmosphere was fun if you like places that are a bit noisy."

Cannot go wrong with anything on their menu. Service is not so good almost all the time. The last time I went with my sister and we sat for 15 minutes before we even got water.

It was very hard to find, didn't even have the name on the building, we drove around the block a few times until we saw the address. The waiting area has a horrible setup and if it's busy people will crowd in front of the host booth. I was skipped twice while trying to get a table.The waiters were all very friendly. I went for breakfast on a Sunday and I think the food is over priced and with a small portion size, tastes good though.The inside is pretty tacky. It looks like they have sheets stapled to the ceiling to hide the insulation. The ceiling lights look like they were held up by those plant hooks that screw into the ceiling, then plugged into a regular outlet just exposed on the ceiling.I honestly don't know how this place ended up on the Food Network. I'd rather go to ihop for breakfast"

The food is consistently tasty, and you can tell that a lot of care and attention is put into the preparation of each dish. The menu is varied, and there are plenty of options to choose from, including some creative twists on classic brunch items.However, one downside is that the coffee leaves much to be desired. If you're a coffee lover, you might be disappointed with the quality of the coffee here. Nevertheless, the quality of the food more than makes up for this minor drawback.Overall, if you're looking for a unique brunch experience that incorporates delicious southern flavors, Toulouse Petit is an excellent choice. The only downside is the wait time, but that's just a testament to how popular and beloved this spot is."

Food quality and taste was kind a all over the place. The Dungeness crab over fried green tomatoes was very good and I'd highly recommend it. Fried half chicken over gravy was also seasoned well and very tasty. The seafood gumbo tasted a little under seasoned, peppery enough, but lacking something. The kurobota pork/gnocchi was the saltiest food I've ever had at a restaurant. It paired well with the gumbo though. The beignets also may not be what people expect. Ours tasted slightly overcooked on the outside but extremely doughy and pasty on the inside. I've heard that's the New Orleans style though. I'd normally give it a lower rating, but it had a very nice vibe and solid service. Presentation was decent, price wasn't too high, and they seemed to be accommodating of groups without reservations. I'd like to try their brunch next time. Overall, the entire covid situation hasn't been particularly great for any restaurant, so it's good to see them still working."

Overall good but Caused a bit of a seen. Bastard door boy asked for my vax card so I hollered at him and floored it and bowled through a bunch of tables.

To drive a specific review though, I took my partner here for birthday brunch. We were told it would be about 45 minutes and it was, in fact, exactly about 45 minutes. The hostess was friendly and set the right expectations, so kudos there. Once seated, our server greeted us and got us on our way. Everything came out quickly and well prepared and was just delicious. Like, seriously good. Everytime. Only negatives are that the parking sucks (that's seattle for you) and that to get to the bathroom, you need to go through the kitchen which honestly weirds me out, but love love love this place."

They said a 20-minute wait and got us in even sooner. The food was delicious--beignets were the star of the show. French press coffee was OK. Service was attentive and friendly. Atmosphere is great, gorgeous wood inlay tables, colorful glass tiles, creative lighting, loved it. One star off because it was super noisy--lots of hard surfaces that bounced sound around plus they play music. But we will totally be back again."

Of course I had to get the fried chicken and it was so juicy. The cocktails are on point too. I had a bourbon and honey cocktail which asked the server to keep them coming... Love the low lighting and all the candles. Host was super nice and sat us in a really nice booth for hour date night. Coming back for sure.

The menu offers a great selection of appetizers and main courses --- almost too many. The specialty cocktails are fun and offer great variety. The only downside is the parking which is a problem near Queen Anne. I cannot wait to return so I can sample more of the menu offerings.

Outstanding. The ""Cajun Meatloaf"" featured a powerful floral aroma of black pepper without the expected kick in the teeth from overseasoning. The butterscotch and banana pie was to die for, and yet barely sweet enough to qualify as desert. Food is served very late, so if you find yourself hungry in Seattle late at night you would do well to check this spot out."

I love the shrimp and grits combo and the jambalaya is really good. A tad salty....but good. I have been here twice so far, once for my anniversary. I did find that the cocktails I ordered were a little bitter and sometimes lacked sweetness that you expect from a cocktail. But the overall flavor was delicious. Just add a little more sweet and it would be perfect. We ordered the Pastini risotto and the corn and sweet onion Macque Choux which was absolutely delish. I would order those again. They were plentiful in size as well. So my husband and I split those while waiting for our entrees. We also ordered the braised and fried bacon which was delicate and cooked perfectly. I just wished there was more. The entrees are a little on the small side and we ordered a half chicken and a ribeye. I had to send the ribeye back because it was way overcooked. But they brought us a new one and didn't charge us for either. Which was awesome. The ribeye they brought us was laid on top of a delicious mash with a blue cheese on the steak. It was so good. My half chicken was also good, but a little lacking in size. Had I only ate the entrees, I would have been left very hungry. I suggest you get sides to go with your meal. It's a little on the expensive side, but it is good. Of course there are some imperfections that could use a little tweaking but overall, I love this place. At the end of our anniversary dinner, the waitress brought us some free beignets in a chicory sauce. The sauce itself was so good and so were the beignets if you've never had one. Granted I've had better at another establishment, but the thought was really nice. They have a huge wine list as well. The atmosphere is lovely and I think you should at least try it once."

The place is known for brunch, which is when I went. The place is busy so you may have to wait. The place is crowded a bit noisy. The service is fairly quick, slow enough to talk but not slow. The food is tasty and hot. The other person that I was with had a crab omelet which actually had chunks of crab, not imitation crab or tiny bits. The portion size is average to slightly large.They have no parking so street parking is what you have to find. On Sundays, it's easy. On other days, if you go for brunch, it's probably ok."

The mussels were great but the sandwich tasted like a salt lick. Not good. If it weren't for that sandwich I would've given 5 stars. The beignets alone are worth coming here for."

We finally got there the other night and got to have a great dinner. Both of my companions enjoyed their food (a ton of really amazing meat, fish, poultry options). I, however, got a great salad and some sides--much to the weird grumbling behavior of my waiter who (every time I asked for something) looked at me like I was from Mars. Hello--high end does great wonders for us vegan/veg--esp when our companions order a butt load from your menu!Everything else was grand--from the setting to the beautiful people eating there. Ok, maybe I am wrong...maybe it wasn't that my waiter was less than stellar because I am veg. We have two theories: 1) (my companions' version) you, pierced waiter, had a crush on me and were jealous that i was two hunky guys or 2) (my version) you, pierced waiter, were jealous that I was coming between you and my two sexxxy male companions would have loved to have eaten you for desert.Go there.

Perfectly poached eggs atop fresh, succulent crab, all smothered in a silky hollandaise sauce. Every bite was a symphony of flavors that transported me straight to New Orleans.Seafood Jambalaya: The seafood jambalaya was spot on. The rice was perfectly cooked, and the medley of seafood--shrimp, crawfish, andouille sausage--was seasoned to perfection. It had just the right amount of spice to leave a lasting impression without overwhelming the palate.The atmosphere at Toulouse Petite is warm and inviting, with a cozy, yet vibrant vibe that makes you feel right at home.

Nestled in a quaint corner, this establishment not only boasts exquisite antique decor but also exudes a warm, inviting ambiance. The staff, with their impeccable service, further elevated my dining experience.Now, let's talk about the star of the show - the Crème Caramel French Toast. This divine creation, adorned with succulent strawberries and luscious pecan butter, is a symphony of flavors. The marriage of crème and caramel is a delight to the senses, but it's the pecan butter that truly steals the show. Its heavenly blend of sweetness and nuttiness leaves you craving for more.As I relish every bite, I must also commend the perfectly crispy strips of bacon that accompany this masterpiece.

However, I recently visited for lunch and was pleasantly surprised with the meal. I enjoyed a Cajun Shrimp Po' Boy with a small salad and side of fries. The Po' Boy was delicious and had a generous amount of shrimp. The salad was well dressed, and the fries were nice and crispy. Although I have been several times it never gets old the New Orleans style atmosphere that breaks up the Seattle Contemporary style that most restaurants fall back on for decoration. The staff was polite and quick to respond before I could ask. All in all, Toulouse should be on your list whether a visitor from out of town or a long-time resident. Thank you for the great lunch and will be dining here again soon. P.S. This is one of, if not the, best brunch spots in Seattle if you like Cajun style foods."

If you're seeking a memorable culinary adventure with exceptional service, this restaurant is a must-visit. :)"

Toulouse Petit Kitchen & Lounge,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/toulouse-petit-kitchen-and-lounge-seattle?not_recommended_start=170,Kristen H.,5.0,1/7/2023,127,WA,"I had been searching for a place to celebrate a birthday dinner with my family, and this place had come highly recommended by many food blogs, friends, and social media accounts. I was skeptical of the legitimacy of a French-Creole restaurant in Seattle, since we unfortunately don't have many restaurants serving that type of cuisine, but I held out hope that this one would prevail, since I love French-Creole food!I made a reservation for 7:30 on a Sunday night, and upon arrival, we were seated immediately. The restaurant was packed to the brim, and the atmosphere was buzzy, but not overly loud. The dining room itself is dark and dimly lit - a perfect ambience for a romantic date. You can tell the painstaking labor put into creating this restaurant, from the thousands of hand-laid tiles to the hundreds of candles the restaurant's staff lights each night (detailed in the back part of the menu, if you want to know more). Service was friendly and helpful, if a bit slow (though I totally understand, since it was a weekend). After getting seated, our waitress asked us if we wanted bread ($7, comes with butter), and it came out a couple minutes later, piping hot and fresh from the oven. It was a pretty authentic French baguette (coming from someone who has had some of Paris's best), though I will say that it is a bit bland, so eat it with the salted butter! The sommelier came out, and my dad ordered an Alsatian red that he was curious about. The somm seemed extremely knowledgeable and was more than happy to talk about the extensive wine list! The wine itself was very fairly priced with minimal markup for a restaurant, and there's really something for everyone on the 16-page list. We ended up ordering four entrees, which we split among the four of us. My entree, the Grimaud Farms Muscovy Duck Confit over Lentils de Puy with Local Butternut Squash ($34), was delicious - the duck was crispy and flavorful, and the lentils were hearty and well-spiced without being heavy. I will say that the portion of my entree was relatively small (the duck leg was small and there wasn't much butternut squash at all), but there was a good amount of lentils. My brother ordered the Big Easy Jambalaya ($33), which comes in a sizzling skillet piled high with prawns, chicken, house-made andouille sausage, and tasso ham. The rice on the bottom was perfectly cooked (not hard, but not mushy at all), and had absorbed the rich, deep Creole flavors of the spice mix and meats on top. It was slightly spicy, but we actually wished it were a little spicier! My mom ordered the Jumbo Wild 'Barbecue Shrimp' New Orleans ($36). The shrimp was well-seasoned, with some sort of Creole seasoning (cayenne pepper and paprika being some standout flavor notes), and they were quite large, as the name suggested. The grits were so rich and creamy (complimented amazingly by the chives/scallions served on top), but we couldn't finish the whole portion for that reason. Finally, my dad ordered the Puget Sound Pacific Mussels with Roasted Shallot-Coriander Paste/Red Basil Nuoc Cham and Pommes Frites and Aioli ($21, $9 extra for frites). This surprised us by being our favorite dish of the night; apart from getting a very generous portion of both mussels and pommes frites, both were perfectly cooked, and we loved the Vietnamese-style sauce that the mussels came in (and we especially loved dipping the baguette in it!). We were so full by the end of the meal that we couldn't even think about getting dessert, but all of the desserts we saw other tables ordering looked amazing, and we would definitely go back to try them another time. Ultimately, I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a romantic date night or a celebratory dinner. No, the prices are by no means cheap, but I think that the portions are fairly generous here, and it's no more expensive than Seattle's other high-end, classy date-night restaurants. The food and ambience couldn't be better, the restaurant itself is beautiful, and the service is great - we'll definitely be going back!"

I ended up googling some stuff myself, just because I rarely eat Creole food. But in the best way, and trying something new. It was cheerful, but cozy, with a velvet banquette of small candles. After ordering custom from the impressive, yet overwhelming, menu, we had prawns, chori and grits."

The restaurant itself was beautiful and atmospheric, and the food was absolutely delicious. They had a wide array of selections for different price ranges, which was appreciated. We had Sea Scallop Coins, the Seafood Gumbo, and an arrangement of 3 of their cheeses. Every dish blew us away, and the service provided by our waiter, Harrison, made this an incredibly memorable experience. He was perceptive, friendly, and good-humored; he even noticed my wife's ring and congratulated us. He even went as far as giving as a plate of beignets as a congratulations--above and beyond service, and I only wish I could have tipped more. After our first night there, we already know we want to come here again as often as we can. I have no complaints about my experience at Toulouse!"

I have been here three times in three weeks and would suggest that everyone go there. I felt wind and dined and like a princess. The bartender went out of his way so much to make me feel special that I actually went home and picked a fight with my husband because I have never had a man wait on me hand and foot the way he did. LOL! When I ran across the street to the store, I came back and found a beautiful glass of wine, dessert, and a complementary to go bag because he wanted me to try a certain dish that I wanted to order but never did. This hospitality went above and beyond any experience I have ever had in a restaurant and it will definitely keep me coming back for more!"

Of course they only seat groups when majority of the group is there so we were bumped a few times which was fine because the hostess was so kind and light hearted about it, making us feel welcomed and not an inconvenience.When we were seated our waitress was very friendly and had very cool, tasteful tattoos that I was very well done; hey weren't tackey. The food came all at once so none of us had to wait for each others orders to arrive which was very impressive seeing that it was very busy and most restaurants will generally serve based on what comes out of the kitchen first. All of it was nice and hot and delicious. I had the Oyster and Bacon Benedict which was perfect. The eggs were poached but still had that delicious running yolk. The oysters where breaded and fried but not cooked all the way through giving it a very ocean-y flavor which I thought added an unique flavor to the entire dish. All the staff was friendly and had a smile on which I know from experience is a very hard thing to do on a Saturday morning during a rush. Definitely coming back here again."

I'm inclined to agree. I've been here somewhere between five and ten times for happy hour and we have barely scratched the surface of the happy hour menu! The sides are the best! Everything is less than five bucks! I especially like the corn grits, the haricots verts with bacon (that's green beans) and the Brussels sprouts. We've tried the alligator and found it to be absolutely delicious, and the basics like several varieties of sliders. And let's not forget dessert! White chocolate bread pudding, apple crisp and pear tart. As a fan of biegnets from Cafe du Monde in New Orleans I was afraid to try an obvious impersonator, but Toulouse biegnets are stand-alone outstanding. I love this place!"

Pork cheek hash was out of this world, and my dining partner had the biscuit and gravy- were fantastic, a sexed up version of the diner classic. Oh-- and daytime drinking- (we were celebrating!) drinks were on special too- the Breakfast Milk Punch & Katie Mae were a wonderful addition to the best Thursday afternoon in my recent memory."

Even better though was the food. My goodness. The best grits I've had in ten years, BBQ prawns, fried green tomatoes, and an AMAZING halibut dish.   Our service was attentive, fast but not rushed (and thats saying something because this place was packed), and the girl running the front door was right on with her menu suggestions!

But I did get a chance to sample almost all of the dishes and the short review: AWESOME. But before I dive into the food, I should mention the decor. The decor is amazing. All the tables were handmade and inlaid with intricate designs. Each table took at least 12 man hours to construct. All the metal work (lights, bottom of tables, partitions in the bathrooms, etc.) were all done and custom built on site. The plaster on the walls was made with many, many layers and then chipped away to reveal all the colors. Amazing. The man hours spent on this restaurant must have been insane. Now food. When I go to a restaurant to do a sampling like this, I usually have a few I like, maybe 1 or two that I love, and a few that are just so-so. Just about everything I had that night was amazingly good. I loved almost every single dish I tried. The dishes all have a New Orleans/Creole/Cajun flair. I had so many dishes that it's hard for me to remember all the goodness. Pork cheek: amazingly tender and terrific seasoning. Alligator: tastes like chicken. Really. And it's great with the mashed potatoes. Gumbo: had two servings. There were lots more, but just can't recall them off my head at the moment. What I do remember most fondly was the bananas fosters. That made me want to weep for happiness. It might have been the booze that I was drinking all night, but that and the other desserts were all amazing. I really can't wait to go back and get full size portions of their food.One other thing that needs to be mentioned is the bar. The bar area occupies the significant majority of the floor space. The liquor porn that's up on that wall is amazing. There's something like 40+ different vodkas (flavors and brands). Again, since I was at a tasting event I didn't see a menu. I left it up to bartender Miles Thomas (who also works at Tavern Law -- another one of my favorites) to pour me some libations. My favorite drink of the night had some gin and champagne in it. I didn't get to see everything that he poured, but I could drink that all night long.I can't wait for Toulouse to officially open. I'll be there often."

The service was slow, and we had to wait nearly an hour for our food to arrive at the table. The extended wait time significantly impacted our overall enjoyment of the evening.

Ended up taking two hours. There were homeless people everywhere outside made for a very uncomfortable wait.

After ordered it took 10 mins to get them. We didn't get our appetizers until 50 mins after we sat down. Appetizers were the best dishes in the house though. Burrata and vegetable tart were amazing. Main courses came 45 mins later and were mediocre. The halibut was over cooked and the meatballs were over taken by the tomato sauce. Less sauce would have been better. The waitress was loud and would engage a table from 3 tables away.Then they started setting up(moving chairs, tables, and just being a distraction while we had dessert.)Overall experience was ""how is this place booked out so far for decent food and the worst fine dining wait staff""?"

However the second time we went i was a bit disappointed with the time it took for our food to come out but at least the waitress gave us some free treats to hold us over. However the reason for the 4 stars is b/c the last time I ate here I felt like the food was too heavy and I had quite a stomach ache for hours.

For brunch, the eggs benedict and quiche were simply unforgettable--comforting classics elevated to a whole new level.The service was just as exceptional. Christie, my server, made phenomenal recommendations that elevated the entire meal. Her warm, attentive energy made me feel right at home. Lotta, the manager, has created an environment that's inviting, cozy, and effortlessly friendly. It's a place where you feel like you know everyone the moment you step in.And then there's Bo, the bartender--a true rockstar whose charisma and spot-on drink pairings added an extra sparkle to the experience. Ba, the owner, runs this café with a style and presence that every restaurant should aspire to emulate.What truly sets Tilikum Place Café apart is its atmosphere.

This turned out to be one of the most rewarding decisions we made that day!If you're planning a visit, take it from us - make a reservation. We were fortunate that a table became available due to a no-show, but it's clear that this place is popular for a reason.The standout item here has to be the Dutch babies. Available in classic, sweet, and savory varieties, these delightful treats are the restaurant's pièce de résistance. Note that they take 25-35 minutes to prepare, but they're worth every delicious moment of anticipation.Our choice was the savory option, an irresistible combination of pancetta, asparagus, spring garlic, and provolone. Served fresh from the oven, it was an indulgent medley of gooey, cheesy goodness enveloped by perfect dough. A hint of hot sauce, thoughtfully brought to our table without prompting, added just the right zing.Complementing our meal was the French onion soup - a sinfully decadent rendition, amplified with crouton, Gruyere, and bacon, and a distinct red wine flavor that made it one of the best I've ever tasted.What sets Tilikum Place Cafe apart, beyond its incredible food, is the ambiance and staff. The entire team is friendly and the space is warm and inviting, creating a comforting environment akin to dining at home with loved ones.Tilikum Place Cafe is more than a meal, it's a memorable dining experience that resonates long after you've savored the last bite. Highly recommend!"

The staff was so accommodating from the start to the end. I'll be back again for another course of a meal."

The service, food, and atmosphere was all grade A. I was just walking by and saw the food from the outside and decided to stop in for some breakfast. From the minute I walked in the door I was greeted by a adorable little lady that gave me the best seat in the house (at the bar next to the kitchen) with no wait time. I order the Dutch Baby Savory with no bacon and the French Press Coffee. The coffee was perfect not to strong not hot. And OMG the Dutch was filled with a perfectly cooked broccoli with creamy cheese and super fluffy bread. If you love carbs and a great cup of coffee you have to check this place out."

Always down for a dutch baby in both the sweet and savory version even though it takes longer to make than other meals but worth it.

Been around Seattle for a while so I feel like I am taking part of keeping 90's Seattle alive by eating here. Service is good even when it gets a bit cramped up in there. At times the brunch wait can be up to an hour-- but more power to them. Glad many like to go there and eat. Not there fault they are popular...can only seat so many folks at once. I have been treated like family and have become a regular. I like the fry up and the dutch baby.

I've eaten dinner twice, and both meals were excellent. Last night, my wife and I shared both a squash tart and an order of calamari stuffed with chorizo with martinis...then a wonderful bowl of parsnip puree soup. Our main courses were a pork chop and a dish of braised rabbit with spinach and mushroom dumplings...but something went wrong. Somehow, the chef thought we wanted the rabbit loin wrapped with pancetta. When the error was discovered in the kitchen, the dish was sent out gratis, and the correct braised rabblt dish was immediately fired. We enjoyed the rabbit loin... and probably would order it again! A very brief wait provided an interlude, then we enjoyed our (correct) entrees.I tell this story because the test of a restaurant is how it addresses problems, and they did a wonderful job of turning a problem into a delightful experience.The Tilikum Cafe is a wonderful, relaxing bistro, and you ought to try them out!"

Watching the chef work his magic was more exciting than some Cirque shows. Hubby had the chicken soup, which had lovely lime undertones. I had the grilled romaine salad with peaches, which was so good, I'm going to try to recreate it at home. Our main courses were the chicken, which understandably is a signature dish. The crusty skin, the herbs/spices, the juiciness of the meat, the mushroom sauce, all worked to create one of the best chicken dishes either of us have ever had. My pasta with hazelnut would have stood out except for how great the chicken was. We shared their signature dessert, profiteroles, served with vanilla ice cream and a caramel sauce flavored with my fav, cardamom. Hubs & I wish a restaurant like this would open in Las Vegas."

I've got unreasonably high standards, and having been repeatedly disappointed by previous gambles on new places, I now prefer to wait until the reviews come in so I can have at least some assurance that I won't be wasting my money and calories. So my husband really had to twist my arm to get me to go to Tilikum Place Cafe for brunch this morning and, to be honest, the only reason I agreed to go is that I was starving and it's just one block away from our condo. ""Be brave!"" he said. ""Uh-uh."" ""Cluck cluck cluck!"" ""Uh-uh."" ""It's right down the alley, you'll be eating in minutes!"" Done!Well chalk one up for hubby. I was encouraged right away when I got what was possibly the best cappuccino of my life, served with a lump of raw sugar and a tiny little shortbread cookie. I felt even more optimistic when we split a tender, house-made orange cream scone. Then I knew everything was going to be okay when we got our main courses. I had a savory Dutch baby with delicata squash and goat cheese, served in the mini-cast iron skillet it was baked in, along with a pitcher of warm maple syrup, and my husband had baked eggs with spinach and bread crumbs. I'm not sure which was better. The eggs were tender and creamy and had those golden crunchy bread crumbs, but the Dutch baby was so light and right on the fence between savory and sweet. We also had a nice little baguette with butter and jam. If you're a quarterback, you're going to want to order more than we did, but for us it was the perfect amount of food, and incredibly our bill (for two people! in Belltown!) came to only $31. Our waitress was charming and attentive, and explained that the owner is also the chef, almost always a good thing in my experience. The food was easily as good as that at, say, Dahlia Lounge or Lola. I can't wait to go back for dinner. I think we're going to wear a groove in the alley between our condo and this place!"

We were told it would be a 25-30 minute wait so we got some coffee and came back 20 minutes later and the host told us they already called our name 5 minutes ago so now we have to go all the way to the bottom of the list.

It's crowded 24/7 with types of people who can't hang because they're usually about to head to Amber after getting hammered here.The gnocchi are boring flour balls that gets slathered in 3 sticks of butter with a bit of truffle oil. I wasn't very impressed by them even though everyone waxes poetic. The calamari I had was too chewy and hardly fried that it lacked texture or crisp. With the crowd nonsense, it takes a long time before your food is ready.The only thing they have going on is their HH wine selection."

I ended up drinking soft foods for over a week due to a broken tooth at this restaurant. The local manager was fine but the senior management had an uncaring attitude could not be flexible to my situation. I found this to be very unfortunate and the worst form of customer relation. My case did not require anything out of ordinary since it only required the chefs to make a customized meal for me. The facts here were that I could either be asked to pay an extra cost or be advised on the other best alternatives. I tried to suggest this to the management and this is where I realized that the middle level management was accommodative of my suggestions, however they could not be able to make a decision without the top management. The unfortunate bit is that the top management felt that since it was a case involving one person it was insignificant. The management should seriously consider better ways of dealing with customers who require special services."

The menu had a nice variety of dishes to choose from and everything we ordered was well prepared and delicious. However, the reason we went to List was for happy hour and unfortunately, the ambiance wasn't quite suited for it. The lighting was quite dim and the space felt a bit cramped, especially since we were a large group of 13 people. Not the convivial milieu we were expecting.Despite this, the servers were fantastic and really did their best to make us feel comfortable. They were very accommodating and attentive to our needs, even going so far as to gift us a complimentary bottle of wine. We appreciated their efforts and thought it was a really nice touch.Overall, I would recommend List to anyone who enjoys good food in a cozy atmosphere. However, I would caution against bringing a large group for happy hour as the space might be a bit cramped. That said, I would definitely come back to List if I was in the area, but perhaps with just one or two other people."

However, the modern and trendy ambiance more than made up for any minor discomfort. The subdued red lighting created an air of sophistication and elegance, and the overall vibe was one of conviviality and warmth.Once seated, I ordered the rigatoni, which was a heavenly combination of creamy sauce and tantalizing spices. The dish was presented with an artistic flair that belied the skill and creativity of the chef.Next, I decided to sample the bacon-wrapped prawns, which were both intriguing and tasty. The combination of the smoky bacon and the succulent prawns was a flavor explosion in my mouth, and while the bacon may have slightly overpowered the prawns, the dish was nonetheless a unique and enjoyable experience.To accompany my meal, I ordered a red blend wine, which was simple and elegant, with subtle notes of fruit and spice that perfectly complemented the flavors of my entrees.In conclusion, despite the small and slightly crowded nature of the establishment, ""List"" is a must-visit for any discerning foodie. The modern and trendy ambiance, combined with the exceptional culinary creations and attentive service, makes this a dining experience that is not to be missed."

Because it's so small a place it gets crowded pretty quickly, especially during their happy hours which start from 4:30. Everything on menu is half price, which, I guess, is great. But I personally prefer a dining experience not involving wait and noise.Now, once you're in you will want to start with a cocktail. I really suggest you sticking with cocktails, because I never had a good wine here. It is cheap, but because it's cheap, it's whatever.

And this way better and bigger than the $32 salmon dinner I had a Lola!The food came out quickly which was amazing given the exceptional quality. Service was almost perfect until the very end of our meal. I know there is a labor shortage, so the bartender was helping bus for the one lone waitress. While clearing our table, she accidently splashed a bit of clam broth on my wife...opps! She gave a verbal apology.

We left on a full stomach we could barely finish our food we ordered so much because of the pricing being incredible. We also just wanted to try a little bit of everything. They serve Macrina bread which if you've never tried, is absolutely incredible. The flatbread is a must try. Thick and delicious. The clams are also served with a tasty broth that makes an incredible combination. Their desert cake is a MUST. warning it is very rich. Overall if pick this place again for good happy hour food."

A+++
List,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/list-seattle?not_recommended_start=90,Whitney B.,5.0,8/6/2013,424,WA,"When I sit down at List, I get this sense that whenever Ikea starts feeling insecure about the reputation of their quality, they'll compensate by sticking their crap inside restaurants that serve good food. So that if ever I purchase white, plastic chairs sturdy enough to brave a Bangladeshi child and gaudy, red, plastic-looking chandeliers for my home, it'll feel like I am eating at List. I guess the more I sit on that thought, I wouldn't be totally against it. I used to be anti-tapas, just because I always viewed them as calorie-ridden appetizers you eat before you indulge in a Five Guys Bacon Cheeseburger. List has changed my mind; tapas are a novel idea. Given the flavors in every dish, it's surprisingly filling and at a great price, too. All of the food here is prepared extremely well but the main stars for me go to the Spicy Meatballs, Chilean Sea Bass, and the Bacon-wrapped Prawns. Don't put me in the same room with those things at the same time; otherwise, what will ensue is a chapter of deleted expletives.The Chilean Sea Bass is an essential fatty acid heaven on top of kale and farro. Whatever sauce they use with which to cook the farro is something I don't want to figure out but I will forego any diet to have more of this dish. The Spicy Meatballs are perfect and there are no adjectives I can use that will make it sound any less inappropriate. Something along the lines of tender, well-seasoned, and has a great sauce. I could cradle them against my bosom and read poetry to them as I tuck them into bed at night. The Bacon-wrapped Prawns is self-explanatory. Like the Bible, you just pick it up and you know where the night's going. The gnocchi and the mushroom soup deserve an honorable mention, as well. Although I am not sure I can say the gnocchi is a must-have being that it's not unique to List and it's not that satisfying because you will definitely need to order something else to complement the dish. It's worth ordering a bottle of wine during happy hour. When you polish off half the bottle in under an hour, you'll get to stumble out of the restaurant like an idiot as I do on occasion.I enjoy their limited menu because it makes it easier on me. I feel like having or being given too many choices is more suited for children under the age of 10. Also with a limited menu, it makes it a no-brainer for the chefs in the back so you get your food quickly but also with an emphasis on consistency. I've been here twice and have had about six or seven different items, all of which have been a hit thus far. It's also a bonus when you're with somebody who knows what they're talking about, as well. This is a touchy-feely, close quarters type of restaurant. When you're there, particularly the bar area, it can start feeling as if you're on a date with everybody sitting there. The music is loud and then the people respond to that by being loud. Small prices to pay for a great meal whether or not it's happy hour."

That said, it's not cheap, but you won't wind up paying $15-20 for an entree if you choose by price. It's one of my favorite local restaurants, if not my absolue top, and, having lived here my entire life, that might be saying something...I rated List 5 accross the board, simply put, because it is."

Highly recommend this one.Mussels: Soft and saucy. The mussels are cooked perfectly and the marinera-like sauce was great for dipping in.Grilled octopus salad: A must have! The octopus is so tender, I can't believe it was octopus! The salad is very citrusy, which I loved. It had quite the kick. Highly recommend this one, too, especially since this is hard to find elsewhere.Gnocchi: The little gnocchis were good, but what makes this dish great was the sauce! The black truffle sauce was very yummy. You'll want to lick the plate at the end.Desert: Ah, I tried just because it was the only dessert they had. I would skip it next time. Nothing too exciting about it. Very small, too. Overall, I do love this place. Great, simple dishes with bold flavors and great presentation."

Brunch/lunch stops at 4:00pm. Literally everything on the menu sounded phenomenal but I ended up going with their Salmon Corn Chowder, Carne Awadallah skillet and Biscuits & Gravy! BUT it wasn't just any gravy - it was mushroom gravy with two poached eggs. So with ordering 3 things we didn't have any room for dessert which is a pity because they're cinnamon rolls looked BOMB. Make sure you save some room for dessert (I know I will next time I'm there)! But I highly recommend the 3 above dishes I was more than happy to indulge in On the drinks side, if you're a cold brew fan you HAVE to try the cold brew tonic. It's supposed to be a ""hit or miss"" but me personally thought it was amazing! Our server even gave us free pastries after the meal.

It wasn't the food, the food was good. Overpriced, but good. It wasn't our waiter, he was great. It was the hostess and even more the bartender/manager. The hostess was rude and insulted us when we pointed out that several parties had been seated out of turn ahead of us. But the manager/bartender is a complete horror show. Her name is A. Wallace and she's the bartender with a lot of tattoos. She was obnoxious, rude and belittled us in front of the restaurant for ""having a bad attitude"". Apparantly we were supposed to be happy about sitting around for nearly 2 hours waiting to be seated while we watched party after party who came after us be seated. We were supposed to be honored to have the hostess be snobby and insult us when we asked to be seated. This whole experience would have been different had the hostess just apologized for her error rather than get defensive, or if the manager had not inexplicably confronted us. She was just awful and should not be working with people in any capacity. If/when this restaruant fails, the owners can easily point to her as a big reasons why."

As long as there are no issues that you bring up, you should enjoy your meal or you could end up with a terrible event like we did.I went to the Walrus and the Carpenter with family...party of 4. We had some delays in getting a seat due to an error made by the hostess. That error caused several other parties to get seated before us. When this error was brought up, the hostess quickly became very defensive informing us we ""don't know the science of the restaurant business"". After a few more words were said back and forth, the hostess offered to cover the first round of drinks. When we were seated, 2 glasses of Champagne where oddly placed on our table by the hostess with no interaction at all. We didn't order Champagne, and there were 4 people at our table not 2. If this was supposed to be our first round of drinks it made no sense at all. Our dinner itself was great. Our server was wonderful and the food was delicious. When the bill was brought...by the manager oddly enough...we noticed we were charged for all the drinks we ordered. We mentioned to her the issue with the hostess, as well as the offer she made and the oddly placed champagnes. I did not get the name of the manager, however she is the woman with the tattoos that I assume most every other negative review on yelp is about. She, like the hostess earlier, quickly became very defensive and rude. She mentioned that she would be willing to help us more, however she felt we were very negative. This situation with the manager was the strangest interaction I have ever had with anyone in a service position. She continued to school us, in front of the rest of the restaurant, on our attitude. She then banned us from ever returning to the resturant. During this mind wrecking event, I mentioned to the manager that this was just bizarre. That was my interaction with the manager, and that got me banned. That was it. No yelling, no foul language, nothing. My partner left the restaurant during this interaction without saying a word due to the absurdness of how we were being treated. It is sad that a beautiful restaurant with great food, and at least one great server, is doing the easiest thing to do right (the hiring of a good hostess and a service oriented manager) horribly wrong. Treat your customers well and they will spread the word about your great food. Treat them like this and you don't have to ban them because they will never return and they will spread the word about the horrible customer service. The owners really need to rethink their staffing and read the reviews on yelp. That manager is a Grimm Reaper in your restaurant, killing off your customers 4 at a time."

Some pretentious PNW restaurants no longer stoop so low as to serve cocktail sauce to accompany our pearls of the sea, but if a 70 year old man who has eaten more oysters then your entire wait and cook staff combined asks for some cocktail sauce, I don't care if you have to high tail it all the way up to Kings to steal some ketchup, but you should make it happen. And please save the lecture about the ""right"" way to eat a PNW oyster, being so ""delicate"" it requires only the most minimalist of accompaniment. Each trip my father makes out here from the last great seafood mecca of New England, I try to show him just how great the shellfish is in the PNW. Instead, you showed how out of control the snobby foodie culture has become in Seattle. While riding the great Ballard Ave bandwagon to success, you have forgotten you table manners. Respecting your elders falls much higher on the food chain than oysters."

While we appreciate the need for table turns, Joe our waiter seemed distant, uninformed on the cuisine and clearly was pushing the course rate to free up the table (""Please don't take our plates yet.""). Our primary culinary disappointments were resident with the overcooked grilled sardines, the undercooked (virtually raw and dripping with fat ) pork belly and bland cheese course (served with oiled (?) walnuts and celery slices) - we did send the pork belly back and our waiter and the kitchen staff agreed with our assessment. Our waiter did provide a free dessert course in consideration for the undercooked pork belly. On a positive culinary note the shigoku oysters, snow creek oysters and green olives were wonderful. All restaurants have off nights for service and cuisine, possibly this was so for The Walrus and the Carpenter."

We liked most of the other seafood dishes, including the crudo's, fried oysters, and the clams. We did not enjoy the sardines with walnuts, however.

They only provide a vinegar-based sauce and horseradish.I've recently tried their geoduck crudo and their fried brussel sprouts. I'd recommend both. Couldn't get enough.

I would highly recommend making a reservation. This place is incredibly popular. A fantastic variety of fresh oysters My boyfriend and I had never had fresh ones like these. Honestly, we didn't know much about how many different kinds and flavors oysters can have! The menu has all the names of the different types and it can be daunting if you have little knowledge of oysters However, our server directed us to try her favorites and educated us about the sweet vs. brine-y.Every oyster we tried was shucked fresh and had been delivered that same day. The owners of the restaurant are very involved and hand pick different oysters on a daily basis! So, it is very likely there will be a different menu selection each time you visit!Atmosphere was super fun! All the tables are very close together and really made the dinner experience unique. One of my favorite items was the bread and butter ! The butter was so delicious with large rock salt in it! Highly recommended!!!"

It was so fresh and the vinegar sauce that came with it compliment it really well. It is very strong so I would recommend dipping it with your fork to taste with the oysters before pouring it right on. I think it goes really well with the after taste of the oysters. So after swallowing the oysters will I get a taste of the vinegar. The baywater sweet was my favorite! Although it was the briniest on our menu, I thought it was a mild briny with a sweet aftertaste. You can't go wrong with any of the oysters though! We also ordered the clams and they were also delicious. Cooked perfectly, sweet, in a savory sauce. Service and staff were very friendly and prompt."

If you love eating simple with a farm to table flare you will love eating here!! We love coming here for the variety of oysters offered and the presentation when they are served makes ordering around a must. The salads in the summer using both vegetables and fruits create pairings that you are not sure about until you enjoy that very first bite. Get there early cause there is a wait but everything about this place makes it worth it.

We enjoyed everything we ordered of the items we ordered. Oysters were very fresh and tasted great. The scallops were perfectly cooked and well seasoned. And the drinks were very good.It was a challenge to get a reservation since this place is very busy and we had small children with us with is probably not the best idea as this is more of a tapas bar than a restaurant. I would recommend making the reservations in advance and not bringing small children if you can avoid it as this place isn't the best environment for children, at least in my opinion, but great for adults looking for good food and great drinks.I'll definitely be back."

I don't know how many dozens of oysters on the half shell we've had here over the years but it would probably be several hundred. A perfect place for a glass of wine and nibbles on sunny days after walking the streets in Ballard and I cannot recommend highly enough.A must do in Seattle and is always a hit with visiting guests.

Since they don't take reservations I made the drive over from the Eastside with my boyfriend on a Wednesday night. Arrived a little before 8pm and got a table right away. Very close seating but I cared about the food AND IT DIDN'T DISAPPOINT! Loved the endive salad! Best beef tartare I've ever had! And the bread and butter were totally worth the add on price. Oh and AMAZING OYSTERS!! (no surprise!) So glad I made it to this Seattle favorite! The bars within the building look darling too so if I go on a weekend I think the wait will be a fun one.

Arrive long before you intend to eat. They don't take reservations, but will put down your number and call when your table is open. They like to scare newbies away by saying it will take 2+ hours for a table. Usually it's much faster. The oysters are top notch. But the small plates are what set them apart from your standard oyster house. I have yet to have a bad dish. The food is creative, fresh and different."

We had such an awesome experience we just had to go back the next day! The atmosphere is bustling and lively. I really liked the open kitchen where you can see the staff at work. My water glass was always full and the service was excellent. We got there early thinking we'd beat the wait, but everyone else had the same idea. The nice thing is there is a great bar next door that serves nice wines and appetizers while you wait.The waitress at the Walrus and the Carpenter made great suggestions for wine and was one of the most knowledgeable people about wine that I've come across. We ordered the scallop tartare, olives, Dinah's cheese, cabbage salad, dried trout, sardines, and octopus. For dessert we had the bread pudding. My recommendations are the oysters, the sardines, and the padron peppers. The cabbage salad was excellent with the sardines. Check it out! You won't be disappointed."

I talk about The Walrus and the Carpenter to anyone who will listen. I've encouraged all of my fellow New Yorkers to go to Seattle simply for this restaurant, which is located in the Ballard neighborhood but could easily be mistaken for parts of hipster and ""it""-scene Brooklyn.The local west coast oysters were shucked perfectly and were the freshest I've ever had. But I knew I was going to get good oysters, so I was equally thrilled by the other dishes and drinks on the menu. You can't go wrong with shishito peppers if they're on the menu toward the end of summer. And if you see the fennel salad on the menu, too, be sure to order it. I've been trying to recreate it in my own home for nearly a year now. Finally, save room for dessert. Fresh blueberry panna cotta melted in my mouth and was the perfect ending to a fantastic meal."

The two of us have never been self-proclaimed oyster connoisseurs, but we do have an affinity for all forms of seafood and shellfish, so we decided to give it a try. The location is hidden within Ballard, and while I don't think I'd want to be walking around there solo at night, the isolation does add to the charm. Lucky for us, we arrived around 5:30pm on a Tuesday (thirty minutes before happy hour ended) and only had to wait for five minutes. Still, it was surprisingly crowded. We ended up sitting at the bar, which I highly recommend if you're just casually going with a friend or date. As you can probably see from all the photos, the interior is intimate, yet bright and lively. Sitting at the bar truly added to this experience. I will admit, that type of dining environment isn't for everyone, and it isn't for every type of occasion, but for a post-work happy hour, it was perfectly light-hearted. My date & I decided to share a variety of plates: we started off with two of each oyster (one for each of us). As we were still there for happy hour, the oysters were less expensive (I believe 20% off, coming in around $1.50 per oyster). The oysters were tasty, but honestly, I probably don't know a superb oyster from a really good one. Those fried oysters, however, were to die for. You must order the fried oysters. The bartender suggested a Muscadet to pair with our meal, which ended up being a perfect addition; we ordered a pichet (about 55% of a bottle) that was happy hour priced. A lot of people have voted against ordering bread, but I'd actually suggest getting it. No, it isn't anything incredible, but it broke up our meal well and was used for soaking up the excess aioli from our fried oysters."

Sometimes the gems are hidden, and I'd have no problem climbing a broken ladder to eat here again (or maybe just to have a late cocktail.) The staff is professional and attentive. I wish I remembered our server's name. :( My friend and I ate here months ago and we really enjoyed ourselves. The oysters, the small plates, the cocktails, and dessert were all fantastic to say the least. My favorite dish was the pork crepinette with romesco (recommended by a friend) and of course the Oysters! They had Fernet so I was pleased! The open kitchen gives a homey vibe, and the intimate ambiance feels pretty dang good...not to mention, it's beautifully designed...simple and elegant. It's one of my new favorite spots in Seattle."

We have not had oysters that fresh in a long time except maybe at the Brooklyn oyster bar downtown. My favorite oyster was a Pacific larger size that began with a T. We where able to get a seat up @ the bar to watch the clever shuckers and bartenders mixing up the love we where about to devour. Cool Decor.We can not wait to go back soon. Wonder if they will ever offer a oyster wine/stout/ or vodka ""flight"" in the near future? I am a big FAN of the Flight pairings but will just have to keep checking back in the meantime. We look forward to hanging out on the the deck out back with a group of our oyster loving friends to sample everything. everything on the menu."

What more does a man need? Service is impeccable. Fried oysters, smoked trout, mussels, and chantrelles were out of this world. Effingham oysters on the half-shell were expertly shucked and served with a ludicrous champagne mignonette and horseradish. All around a great experience. Can't wait to go back"
