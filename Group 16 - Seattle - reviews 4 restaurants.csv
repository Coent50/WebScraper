The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Alex H.,1.0,12/23/2023,I go to this place often to grab some oysters. Usually have a great experience. Whoever was the hostess tonight made me never want to return. I walk in at 10:25 to be seated and am told their kitchen closes at 10:30. Which is odd cause I've never been told this especially cause I only order oysters and a few drink around this time and day. Needless to say I won't be back.
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,emily c.,1.0,10/11/2023,"I am still reeling from shock of how horribly myself and my family were treated. I, visibly pregnant, was seated at a table with a bench on one side and 2 chairs on the other. My 2yo and 5yo were both sitting with me on the bench side waiting for my husband to arrive. There were 3 other similar tables next to us, all still unseated. The hostess kindly brought us crayons for my children to color on the paper laid across the table. My daughter was coloring, never straying once from our table. My son was guardian of the crayons. On three occasions, my *near 2yo* screamed loudly ""MINE!"" when my daughter went for a crayon. I am well aware this is less than ideal. It is a phase he is in, screeching any time he is excited or mad or expressing emotions. Before and after each of those moments, he was calm and happy and just fine. Each time he did it, I did my best to get him to stop immediately. We had been there all but 10 minutes. The manager, Christopher Fischbach, approached me and said ""You are going to have to reign this in."" I asked ""excuse me?"" And he said ""you are going to have to reign this in. We can't have your children running around and the screaming will have to stop."" I replied that my daughter hadn't left the table once and then asked how he suggest I stop my not yet 2yo son from screaming?"" He said he didn't know. I asked ""and what if I can't? Will we be escorted out?"" And he said ""if it is excessive, maybe so. We have to seat these other tables.""At this point I was so incredulous, I could not believe this was being said to a paying customer, let alone the fact that a child was being targeted. I asked if this was routine for them, he did not reply and he walked away. I still cannot believe this happened. I am appalled. I am ashamed to say that we stayed, but I refuse to be bullied. Yeah, they got my money, but I have my dignity. And I hope Christopher (who, no, does not have children of his own) treats families trying their absolute best with the respect they deserve moving forward. He was a pretty massive disappointment to humanity tonight.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money here. The food was not remotely worth what they lack entirely in service."

I came here one night and knew I had to get the spicy jumbo wings, they good, but just drenched in fish sauce and it was just so heavily breaded that it wasn't much meat underneath. Now don't get me wrong, I can handle my fish suave being that I'm Vietnamese, but this was just too much for me. We also got the shrimp paste grilled on lemongrass stalks and that too was just way too over powering and made it almost too bitter to eat. Over all the decorations were fun and interesting to look at. The cocktails were mediocre. And the wait is always so long, there are better Thai restaurants in the area with no wait and food you can actually enjoy."

Tastes great though.Price on this item was $20. Yes, you get less than half the portion you expect. Totally overpriced.

I came here one night and knew I had to get the spicy jumbo wings, they good, but just drenched in fish sauce and it was just so heavily breaded that it wasn't much meat underneath. Now don't get me wrong, I can handle my fish suave being that I'm Vietnamese, but this was just too much for me. We also got the shrimp paste grilled on lemongrass stalks and that too was just way too over powering and made it almost too bitter to eat. Over all the decorations were fun and interesting to look at. The cocktails were mediocre. And the wait is always so long, there are better Thai restaurants in the area with no wait and food you can actually enjoy."

Usually have a great experience. Whoever was the hostess tonight made me never want to return. I walk in at 10:25 to be seated and am told their kitchen closes at 10:30. Which is odd cause I've never been told this especially cause I only order oysters and a few drink around this time and day. Needless to say I won't be back.
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,emily c.,1.0,10/11/2023,"I am still reeling from shock of how horribly myself and my family were treated. I, visibly pregnant, was seated at a table with a bench on one side and 2 chairs on the other. My 2yo and 5yo were both sitting with me on the bench side waiting for my husband to arrive. There were 3 other similar tables next to us, all still unseated. The hostess kindly brought us crayons for my children to color on the paper laid across the table. My daughter was coloring, never straying once from our table. My son was guardian of the crayons. On three occasions, my *near 2yo* screamed loudly ""MINE!"" when my daughter went for a crayon. I am well aware this is less than ideal. It is a phase he is in, screeching any time he is excited or mad or expressing emotions. Before and after each of those moments, he was calm and happy and just fine. Each time he did it, I did my best to get him to stop immediately. We had been there all but 10 minutes. The manager, Christopher Fischbach, approached me and said ""You are going to have to reign this in."" I asked ""excuse me?"" And he said ""you are going to have to reign this in. We can't have your children running around and the screaming will have to stop."" I replied that my daughter hadn't left the table once and then asked how he suggest I stop my not yet 2yo son from screaming?"" He said he didn't know. I asked ""and what if I can't? Will we be escorted out?"" And he said ""if it is excessive, maybe so. We have to seat these other tables.""At this point I was so incredulous, I could not believe this was being said to a paying customer, let alone the fact that a child was being targeted. I asked if this was routine for them, he did not reply and he walked away. I still cannot believe this happened. I am appalled. I am ashamed to say that we stayed, but I refuse to be bullied. Yeah, they got my money, but I have my dignity. And I hope Christopher (who, no, does not have children of his own) treats families trying their absolute best with the respect they deserve moving forward. He was a pretty massive disappointment to humanity tonight.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money here. The food was not remotely worth what they lack entirely in service."

As you've probably gathered, my partner is a transgender woman and I fully support/love her, we were eating at the Old Spaghetti Factory in Southcenter when my partner said she felt someone staring at her, I was going to assure her that kno one was staring, however, I was appalled to see this kid working there standing in the kitchen entrance pointing at her, I stared the kid down until he walked away. I immediately asked for the manager, the manager who came over to help us was completely drunk, he asked us if we were sure he was pointing at us, and he offered to pay for our food. This place is a whole bundle of bad memories for us now. Time to go to Cheesecake Factory instead."

Dry mix mala noodles come out hot and watery, it's funny to call it ""mala"". Popcorn Chicken with Honey Mustard... All in all, this was the top seller among the many Biang Biang-style noodle joints across the country.(original)The service was quick and good, but the food left much to be desired. The dry mix mala noodle turns out to be lukewarm water, and it is called ""mala"" and spoken. The popcorn chicken was served with martyr's heads...

While the wait time after ordering was a bit lengthy, clocking in at 25 minutes for a bowl of noodles, the taste was okay, though not particularly surprising. Unfortunately, the Popcorn Chicken didn't live up to expectations; it's definitely not recommended as it didn't taste like it was supposed to.To add to the disappointments, my Mike tea never arrived, but the server promptly addressed it by removing it from the bill. Getting water refilled proved challenging, possibly due to a busy time and a shortage of servers during the shift. Despite these drawbacks, the server's attentiveness in handling issues and the acceptable noodle taste make me consider giving Biang Biang Noodle another chance, hoping for improvements. Three stars for now."
