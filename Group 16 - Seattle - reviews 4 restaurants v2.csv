Usually have a great experience. Whoever was the hostess tonight made me never want to return. I walk in at 10:25 to be seated and am told their kitchen closes at 10:30. Which is odd cause I've never been told this especially cause I only order oysters and a few drink around this time and day. Needless to say I won't be back.

I, visibly pregnant, was seated at a table with a bench on one side and 2 chairs on the other. My 2yo and 5yo were both sitting with me on the bench side waiting for my husband to arrive. There were 3 other similar tables next to us, all still unseated. The hostess kindly brought us crayons for my children to color on the paper laid across the table. My daughter was coloring, never straying once from our table. My son was guardian of the crayons. On three occasions, my *near 2yo* screamed loudly ""MINE!"" when my daughter went for a crayon. I am well aware this is less than ideal. It is a phase he is in, screeching any time he is excited or mad or expressing emotions. Before and after each of those moments, he was calm and happy and just fine. Each time he did it, I did my best to get him to stop immediately. We had been there all but 10 minutes. The manager, Christopher Fischbach, approached me and said ""You are going to have to reign this in."" I asked ""excuse me?"" And he said ""you are going to have to reign this in. We can't have your children running around and the screaming will have to stop."" I replied that my daughter hadn't left the table once and then asked how he suggest I stop my not yet 2yo son from screaming?"" He said he didn't know. I asked ""and what if I can't? Will we be escorted out?"" And he said ""if it is excessive, maybe so. We have to seat these other tables.""At this point I was so incredulous, I could not believe this was being said to a paying customer, let alone the fact that a child was being targeted. I asked if this was routine for them, he did not reply and he walked away. I still cannot believe this happened. I am appalled. I am ashamed to say that we stayed, but I refuse to be bullied. Yeah, they got my money, but I have my dignity. And I hope Christopher (who, no, does not have children of his own) treats families trying their absolute best with the respect they deserve moving forward. He was a pretty massive disappointment to humanity tonight.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money here. The food was not remotely worth what they lack entirely in service."

The problem was the cost of the food for the quantity and quality. We really went to see the perfomace thinking it would be a fun way to spend dinner. Well the performace is five minutes at best, every 30-45 minutes so don't go for that. The food was way over priced. I spent $44.00 for a small bowl of (premade) gluten free pasta with a bland cream sauce, a butterscotch pudding (which was pretty good) and a glass of water-yes $44!!! . Since I had to eat GF I didn't get bread unless I wanted to pay $3 more for Udi's bread. There were no dinner salads, veggies, meat for my dish or anything else. I hate the Italian Denny's (Olive Garden) but have to say I have had better meals there and for a better price. Felt a bit duped by the allure of a cool performace which is the only reason I was willing to spend that kind of money on pasta only to find out it the performance wasn't really part of the ambiance.

We ordered sodas while taking a moment to look at the wine menu, and decided to share an order of the calamari with spinach. This was okay, a bit overcooked and chewy, but we had high hopes for the meal - I ordered linguine with clams, and my husband ordered clams and mussels.I had one bite of my pasta with clams, and couldn't eat anymore. The pasta was overcooked, but all of that was masked by the amount of sodium in the ""broth"" - you could taste nothing BUT salt, as though a cup of it had been poured into the cooking liquid. The acidity burned my tongue and scoured the inside of my mouth. I couldn't taste or eat properly for two days afterward. My husband's clams and mussels had no seasoning or taste, other than that of steamed and overcooked seafood. No garlic, wine, herbs or anything else. It was as if they'd steamed the shellfish and dumped them in the bowl. Also, no pasta or other sides were served with that dish: $26 or so for a bowl of flavorless steamed mussels and clams. We declined to order something else, and asked for our check. This was the only time in our lives that we've ever walked out of a restaurant. Although the manager comped our soda and calamari, we left a comparable amount on the table for the waitress and staff. We figured they shouldn't be left without the tip they'd have received had the chef and kitchen staff not put out such an embarassing ""meal"". We spent an hour trying to find another restaurant that was open in the area after 9 PM, which oddly enough is not easy to do, especially as we'd walked from our rental to The Pink Door.As far as ambience and staff: the greeter and our waitress were very nice. The place was okay, but other than some cute decoration and a good band, it wasn't exceptional - certainly not enough to balance out the mediocre starter and inedible meal. I can honestly say I'd not recommend this restaurant to anyone."

After reading the rave reviews, I was excited to check it out. I ordered the seasonal Love Fest drink and the spinach pasta lasagna. Both were absolutely delicious--the best lasagna and cocktail I've ever had. Despite it being pretty packed and not having a reservation, the host kindly offered me a seat at the bar. I didn't mind since I was dining solo. The bartender was very friendly and made me laugh as we chatted about San Francisco, my hometown. The ambiance was charming, with a dark yet cozy interior and live music, which was a lovely bonus.Fast forward to my second visit, which was during my birthday weekend on a solo trip to Seattle. I decided to have my birthday dinner at The Pink Door. Unfortunately, this experience was vastly different. I arrived around 8 PM, close to the last call for dinner, so the restaurant was quite empty. Despite this, the host insisted I sit at the bar again, which felt odd since there were plenty of empty tables and I wanted a more traditional dining experience for my birthday. I ordered an orange cocktail (can't remember the name), and while the waitress carded me, she didn't acknowledge my birthday at all. Additionally, my water cup was only refilled by a passing busser rather than my waitress, who seemed inattentive. The lasagna was just as delicious as before, but the service this time was extremely disappointing. It felt like they weren't interested in providing good service during the last call.The food at The Pink Door is amazing, but the service can be hit or miss. They definitely need to improve their service, especially for customers who dine during quieter times."

Our server and the overall service on the other hand was less than subpar and rude at times. I came here with my girlfriend knowing I was going to spend a few hundred dollars and we were taken to our seat and immediately told by our young male server that when he is in our presence we have to put our masks on which I am 100% on board with preventative measures regarding covid however when im in a restaurant sat across from one person while our server is 6ft apart it didn't make sense but we went with it. Putting his unapproachable attitude to one side, we literally had to wait close to 20 minutes to even order our first drink which again showed either his lack of understanding in the customer service industry or lack of respect to his patrons. I know he isn't a true representation of this establishment because of the many other great reviews but when youre spending hundred of dollars on a meal, the environment and service should be a solid part of the package and this was lacking. I have been to nearly 8 restaurants over my vacation here in Seattle and this guy ruined what would be an amazing 5 star place. Would not recommend to friends or family."

My wife and I were really looking forward to going and we thought it was a bit of a classy place, judging by the website. Turns out, it's not. Luckily for us, we got to sit inside, but the tables outside all had plastic picnic type table cloths. The restaurant is located in an alley and it fits in with the Public Market scene, but definitely not with the classy scene that it portrays on the website. The food wasn't that great either, ESPECIALLY for the price we paid. I had the spaghetti, which came with no garlic bread or anything and my wife had the steak, which was more bone than actual meat. The main reason we wanted to go was for the trapeze artist, which was supposed to be performing from 6:30-9PM, so I made our reservation for 6:30PM. The whole hour and a half that we were there, she performed for 2 songs. That's it! The trapeze artist isn't something that should be advertised if she isn't going to perform. Overall, I definitely won't be returning to The Pink Door. It's just not worth the money. It's nothing spectacular."

While my experience had its highlights, there were a few aspects that left me wanting more.Let's start with the positives. The service at The Pink Door was exemplary. From the moment I stepped through the pink-hued entrance, the staff greeted me with warm smiles and made me feel welcome. They were attentive, knowledgeable, and ensured that my dining experience was smooth and enjoyable. Kudos to the staff for their exceptional service!The drink selection at The Pink Door was a true delight. The bar is well-stocked and the mixologists behind it know their craft. I tried a couple of their signature cocktails, and each one was expertly crafted, bursting with unique flavors and beautifully presented. If you're a fan of creative libations, The Pink Door will not disappoint.Now, onto the food. While the dishes at The Pink Door were undeniably well-prepared, I found them to be on the pricier side. It's true that quality ingredients and a skilled culinary team come at a cost, but I couldn't help but feel that the prices were a tad steep for what was served.Specifically, the pasta, often hailed as an Italian staple, left me somewhat underwhelmed. While it was cooked to a perfect al dente texture, the flavors fell slightly short of my expectations. The dishes lacked that extra oomph that elevates a good pasta to a memorable one. Perhaps a bit more attention to seasoning and innovative flavor combinations would enhance the overall dining experience.Despite these shortcomings, The Pink Door does possess its fair share of merits. The attentive service and the remarkable drinks are definite highlights that shouldn't be overlooked. However, I would encourage the restaurant to refine their flavors and consider adjusting their pricing to offer better value for the culinary experience they aim to provide.In summary, The Pink Door is a decent Italian restaurant with good service and amazing drinks. While the food may be a bit expensive and the pasta lacks a little bit of flavor, it's still a place worth visiting if you're in the mood for a charming atmosphere and attentive service."

The cocktails were on the lower end of OK. The food was good, not great. The whole thing was just OK. I think if the hostess had seemed happy we were there, it would have started us on a better track. We wouldn't go back, but I guess it's worth one visit."

Hidden in an alley near Pike Market and only identifiable by their signature pink door, this restaurant feels like stepping into an old vaudeville theater. When we went, there was a live band with an amazing vocalist playing blues/Americana music. The pasta was good but the dishes could've used more sauce that was a consensus from all. The prices are affordable that's for sure. We stayed for a few hours, enjoyed the food, atmosphere, jazz band and company. The service could've been quicker but the waitress was extremely nice and knowledgeable. There's no reason why I wouldn't go back."

We found it by chance and it really does have a nondescript pink door. But when you walk inside, you get the feeling of warmth, history and elegance. The food was fantastic and they easily accommodated my no grain eating challenges. Their house infused olive oil was out of this world. We had filet of sole and a butternut squash risotto with shrimp. Could not have been better. We wanted to keep eating because it was so good but were full! Wait staff was friendly and attentive.

The environment was so good with delicious aromas of foods spread all over. Our ordered food was served so well and it was so appealing to my taste buds. Our server was very friendly. He gave us the details of all the dishes and so it was easy to decide then.

Had the lobster ravioli and the eggplant pasta for course. The administration was brisk, the server helped us pick sustenance. We finished supper on olive oil cake with orange and pomegranate sauce - it was immaculate! Provincial old fashioned feel, the unrecorded music after some time just develops the air! PS: Ask for the seat by the window, you may very well get it as we did ! :)"

These are pretty rare, but it's definitely worth spending one on the Pink Door's elevated patio. In fact, make an evening of it by putting on that swooshy little dress you paid too much for and a spritz of expensive perfume. I love their wild mushroom risotto and they make a damn good caesar too. Of course you will enjoy a glass of wine or other pretty drink, and your companion will find you enchanting."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=140,Jay R.,4.0,5/25/2018,2,CA,So Good!That's all that i really want to add. So suck it up.

The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=160,Shay L.,4.0,11/1/2017,7,WA,One of most vintage and collectively put together restaurants I have been to in Seattle. The simple but elegant aesthetic adds a nice touch to the vibe and provided my time there with relaxing energy. I indulged in the spaghetti with meatballs and enjoyed the simplicity in the flavors.Everything blended well and gave my palled a sweet but organic dance. The pricing is far and if you have dessert you're only coming out of your pocket about 40$. HIGHLY recommended!!!!
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=160,Jan Q.,4.0,10/23/2017,141,CA,"Amazing experience. Delicious food. Great service. Long wait(didn't have a reservation), WORTH THE WAIT."

We started with the cheeseboard and it was the perfect start to the meal. I had the Linguine alle Vongole and the clams were so fresh it was one of the best linguine's I've had. My partner had the Lasagna, which he said was amazing. We were really pleased with this restaurant and definitely plan to come back on our next trip to Seattle."

Small jazz band trio was play on a Tuesday night. Loved the food and creative drink menu. We went back on another night since we liked this place so much. I also learned that they have acrobats that work the indoor swings on some evenings for added entertainment.

I came here and had the grilled Caesar salad and it's hands down the most delicious plate I've ever had. It was so good I couldn't even wait to take a picture. I also ordered the tuna tartare and shared the red sauce pasta! I'm so pleased with the quality of the food here. We also bought a bottle of Sangiovese and it was on point. Classy feel, classy restaurant! Such a great experience!!"

I eagerly asked our waitress for more bread so I can lap it all up. My girlfriend ordered the risotto which was so craftily made and had such exquisite flavor and wasn't overcooked nor undercooked but just right. For dessert we got the apricot and strawberry crumble which was too sweet, but thank god we had some ice cream to tone it down."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=170,Shawna R.,4.0,8/4/2016,10,CA,"Excellent spot for a cocktail and a great atmospheres. Traveled here with some friends and this place was recommended by the hotel concierge and once we got there we knew why. Excellent selection and the bartenders knew what they were doing. They were very knowledgable and didn't have to stick to the menu, they offered to make anything with any individual ingredients that you like. Step right in and enjoy"

I 'd been here once before, and had an excellent experience, so I convinced the group to check it out. As before, there was an accordion group, which totally rocked (we lucked out and got a table close to the stage). I went with the chilly dungeness crab dish, and between the four of us, we killed two bottles of wine, and totally enjoyed ourselves. Everyone adored their plates too, and the desserts were divine. Highly recommended."

Undoubtedly one of these areas which makes you feel as if you have finally found the city and broken out of the tourist routine, regardless of the closeness to Pike's Place I could not decide between 4 and 5 stars, but it gets five to counter all the whinging."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=170,Jay S.,4.0,3/24/2016,14,WA,"Burlesque, Italian food... what is not to like?!The patio in the back is where all the real action is (weather permitting). Decent views of the water and downtown.They have some vegan options here, which was a nice surprise (I am not Vegas but when going with friends). I am a big fan of the puttanesca.I have only seen the ""show"" once, and it was entertaining but the real star is the food.Its called the Pink door because, other than the pink door, you wouldn't know how to find the joint.The bar across the alley was a great place to go after to continue the celebrations. I am drawing a blank on the name."

All these are quite uncommon, but it is definitely worth spending one on the Pink Door's raised veranda. Actually, make an evening of it by putting on that swooshy small clothing you paid too much for and a spritz of expensive cologne. I really like their wild mushroom risotto and they make a bloody great caesar also. Of course you may appreciate a glass of wine or another pretty beverage, as well as your company will see you enchanting."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=180,Sonya T.,4.0,2/9/2016,5,CA,Coming to this place was an interesting experience with the rustic pink door entrance. Plus knowing it was more of a pub it sort of threw the feel off. All the art on the walls and building was a please surprise and was excited about the whole place.The lasagna was fantastic and given the reviews from everyone else it's no suprise as well. Lasagna with some tabasco sauce makes it even better. Especailly with some heat makes the pallet just open up to bring the favor in that much more.
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=180,Brittany K.,4.0,1/28/2016,2,WA,"Really good food, great for a night out, can get pricey but the food is definitely worth it, in the summer you can sit on the balcony which is a huge plus, parking can be hard to find sometimes due to the prime location."

It was my birthday and my friends wanted something different than the usual so we tried it. Overall the food was good, all of our different wines were wonderful and we liked the atmosphere. We went on a Saturday evening so were able to watch the trapeze act. I'm told that they have 3 different trapeze acts a night but we only saw the first one. A little disappointing but still a unique experience. On Sundays they have a Vaudeville type of show that we haven't seen and may go back for that sometime. One note to others who have not been....there is no sign to indicate where the restaurant is outside. You enter from Post Alley and you must look for a kinda pink door to enter the Pink Door. Guess we should have read the yelp reviews before going :)"

The entertainment can be fun. Their appetizers tend to be on the spot. They have nice hours (good for people who work late and whatnot).Pink Door has been a consistently good spot. The particular highlights have been the pasta and the appetizers. Their pappardelle ragu is great! Most often Pink Door has been delivered via Postmates. It's one of the most solid bets for Italian we've found for delivery."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=190,Crystal N.,4.0,9/9/2015,187,CA,"It's been two months since my friends and I visited The Pink Door and my mouth is still watering whenever I think about how amazing the pesto lasagna was. I never thought a simple looking dish could taste that incredible. It's a must-order. The calamari was excellent as well. We assumed it was the usual deep fried dish but it wasn't. It was a nicely sauteed dish with garlic, tomatoes, spinach and white wine. When you enter through the pink door, you'll be mesmerized by how pretty the place is. It's an ambiance I'd imagine my reception to have if I had a small wedding party. The setting was whimsical, elegant and romantic.The back part of the restaurant has a more laid-back feel and is also where the bar is located! There's also an outdoor seating area - perfect to enjoy a meal with your S/O or friends."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=190,Aj G.,4.0,7/24/2015,6,CA,"You Gotta Go Once... this is one of those places that is the complete experience. Right from the start, the whole idea that there is no sign, just a pink door on an alley, gets you in the theme. It's not that hard to find if you pay attention, and look over the wall and see all the people dining on the deck that hangs over the water with an amazing view. Once inside, it's got that old Seattle brothel dcor, and if you time it right, a trapeze artist twirling around for her 5 minute performance every 30 minutes. If you book online, it's for seating outside. We were there during a rare heatwave, so outside at night was great. Perfect view of the water, the Great Wheel, and a cool statue on the neighbor's balcony next door.The service was good, friendly, attentive, informative. The food was tasty, but my two teenaged sons reported it was not enough food. They both ordered the Pappardelle, which was only that on a plate. I ordered a really juicy piece of freshly caught king salmon, and my husband ordered cioppino. My plate was the tastiest, simple and fresh. The cioppino was good, but neither a brothy soup or a plated dinner, it was somewhere in between.If you somehow book a table inside, it's more crowded, intimate, and entertaining for sure. On Saturdays they have a cabaret show, which is separate from the meal."

Their Cesar sounds so simple but its so good either add the shrimp or the crab. We tried the fish of the day and cioppino. Let me just say Seattle gets down with their see food. This place is always busy and they have live music almost everyday of the week. The entrance in an alley way so its fun to find. Close to Pike Market and Downtown. Very Romantic and from now on will make it a point to dine here every time I come to Seattle."

The menu could of have a few more options, however all the food was good quality. I will for sure take my wife back in the summer for the out door seating our waiter mentioned to us. Slightly over priced so it is more of a special occasion restaurant. Parking around there was hard to find but I guess I have to expect that by pike place."

Pink Door impresses with its thoughtfully crafted dishes and inviting atmosphere. The Ahi Tuna Crudo was fresh and bright and was complemented by fried capers and microgreens, creating a balanced plate with delightful textures and flavors. The Lasagna Pink Door, rich with spinach and perfectly melted cheese, exceeded my expectations despite not being a huge lasagna fan. The Lemon Risotto with Prawns had a bright, lemony taste that wasn't overpowering. The creamy risotto was decadent yet light, while the prawns were large, flavorful, and juicy. For dessert, the Tiramisu was creamy with soft, spongey ladyfingers and a pleasant coffee taste. The Espresso Martini, though smooth and potent, left me wishing for a creamier texture, but that's personal preference. Reservations can be hard to come by, but walk-ups are an option if you're willing to wait. The beautifully decorated interior and attentive, friendly service make Pink Door a charming spot worth the effort to visit."

Our waitress, Krista, did an excellent job recommending meals, appetizers, and drinks. She was attentive, ensuring our waters were always filled, which added to the overall positive experience.The ambiance was wonderfully relaxing, enhanced by a beautiful view of The Sound and West Seattle. The setting alone makes this place worth visiting.Now, onto the food. The lemon risotto is a must-try; it's perfectly balanced and flavorful. The crab and corn salad appetizer is another standout, bringing the freshness of Northwest crab right to your table. However, the oil served with the bread could be improved; it's a bit lacking for dipping six pieces of bread. A little more oil would go a long way.Despite this minor detail, Pink Door is a must-go destination. Just be sure to look for the huge line, as the entrance can be easy to miss.---"
