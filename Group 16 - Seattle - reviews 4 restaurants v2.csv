Usually have a great experience. Whoever was the hostess tonight made me never want to return. I walk in at 10:25 to be seated and am told their kitchen closes at 10:30. Which is odd cause I've never been told this especially cause I only order oysters and a few drink around this time and day. Needless to say I won't be back.

I, visibly pregnant, was seated at a table with a bench on one side and 2 chairs on the other. My 2yo and 5yo were both sitting with me on the bench side waiting for my husband to arrive. There were 3 other similar tables next to us, all still unseated. The hostess kindly brought us crayons for my children to color on the paper laid across the table. My daughter was coloring, never straying once from our table. My son was guardian of the crayons. On three occasions, my *near 2yo* screamed loudly ""MINE!"" when my daughter went for a crayon. I am well aware this is less than ideal. It is a phase he is in, screeching any time he is excited or mad or expressing emotions. Before and after each of those moments, he was calm and happy and just fine. Each time he did it, I did my best to get him to stop immediately. We had been there all but 10 minutes. The manager, Christopher Fischbach, approached me and said ""You are going to have to reign this in."" I asked ""excuse me?"" And he said ""you are going to have to reign this in. We can't have your children running around and the screaming will have to stop."" I replied that my daughter hadn't left the table once and then asked how he suggest I stop my not yet 2yo son from screaming?"" He said he didn't know. I asked ""and what if I can't? Will we be escorted out?"" And he said ""if it is excessive, maybe so. We have to seat these other tables.""At this point I was so incredulous, I could not believe this was being said to a paying customer, let alone the fact that a child was being targeted. I asked if this was routine for them, he did not reply and he walked away. I still cannot believe this happened. I am appalled. I am ashamed to say that we stayed, but I refuse to be bullied. Yeah, they got my money, but I have my dignity. And I hope Christopher (who, no, does not have children of his own) treats families trying their absolute best with the respect they deserve moving forward. He was a pretty massive disappointment to humanity tonight.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money here. The food was not remotely worth what they lack entirely in service."

The problem was the cost of the food for the quantity and quality. We really went to see the perfomace thinking it would be a fun way to spend dinner. Well the performace is five minutes at best, every 30-45 minutes so don't go for that. The food was way over priced. I spent $44.00 for a small bowl of (premade) gluten free pasta with a bland cream sauce, a butterscotch pudding (which was pretty good) and a glass of water-yes $44!!! . Since I had to eat GF I didn't get bread unless I wanted to pay $3 more for Udi's bread. There were no dinner salads, veggies, meat for my dish or anything else. I hate the Italian Denny's (Olive Garden) but have to say I have had better meals there and for a better price. Felt a bit duped by the allure of a cool performace which is the only reason I was willing to spend that kind of money on pasta only to find out it the performance wasn't really part of the ambiance.

We ordered sodas while taking a moment to look at the wine menu, and decided to share an order of the calamari with spinach. This was okay, a bit overcooked and chewy, but we had high hopes for the meal - I ordered linguine with clams, and my husband ordered clams and mussels.I had one bite of my pasta with clams, and couldn't eat anymore. The pasta was overcooked, but all of that was masked by the amount of sodium in the ""broth"" - you could taste nothing BUT salt, as though a cup of it had been poured into the cooking liquid. The acidity burned my tongue and scoured the inside of my mouth. I couldn't taste or eat properly for two days afterward. My husband's clams and mussels had no seasoning or taste, other than that of steamed and overcooked seafood. No garlic, wine, herbs or anything else. It was as if they'd steamed the shellfish and dumped them in the bowl. Also, no pasta or other sides were served with that dish: $26 or so for a bowl of flavorless steamed mussels and clams. We declined to order something else, and asked for our check. This was the only time in our lives that we've ever walked out of a restaurant. Although the manager comped our soda and calamari, we left a comparable amount on the table for the waitress and staff. We figured they shouldn't be left without the tip they'd have received had the chef and kitchen staff not put out such an embarassing ""meal"". We spent an hour trying to find another restaurant that was open in the area after 9 PM, which oddly enough is not easy to do, especially as we'd walked from our rental to The Pink Door.As far as ambience and staff: the greeter and our waitress were very nice. The place was okay, but other than some cute decoration and a good band, it wasn't exceptional - certainly not enough to balance out the mediocre starter and inedible meal. I can honestly say I'd not recommend this restaurant to anyone."

After reading the rave reviews, I was excited to check it out. I ordered the seasonal Love Fest drink and the spinach pasta lasagna. Both were absolutely delicious--the best lasagna and cocktail I've ever had. Despite it being pretty packed and not having a reservation, the host kindly offered me a seat at the bar. I didn't mind since I was dining solo. The bartender was very friendly and made me laugh as we chatted about San Francisco, my hometown. The ambiance was charming, with a dark yet cozy interior and live music, which was a lovely bonus.Fast forward to my second visit, which was during my birthday weekend on a solo trip to Seattle. I decided to have my birthday dinner at The Pink Door. Unfortunately, this experience was vastly different. I arrived around 8 PM, close to the last call for dinner, so the restaurant was quite empty. Despite this, the host insisted I sit at the bar again, which felt odd since there were plenty of empty tables and I wanted a more traditional dining experience for my birthday. I ordered an orange cocktail (can't remember the name), and while the waitress carded me, she didn't acknowledge my birthday at all. Additionally, my water cup was only refilled by a passing busser rather than my waitress, who seemed inattentive. The lasagna was just as delicious as before, but the service this time was extremely disappointing. It felt like they weren't interested in providing good service during the last call.The food at The Pink Door is amazing, but the service can be hit or miss. They definitely need to improve their service, especially for customers who dine during quieter times."

Our server and the overall service on the other hand was less than subpar and rude at times. I came here with my girlfriend knowing I was going to spend a few hundred dollars and we were taken to our seat and immediately told by our young male server that when he is in our presence we have to put our masks on which I am 100% on board with preventative measures regarding covid however when im in a restaurant sat across from one person while our server is 6ft apart it didn't make sense but we went with it. Putting his unapproachable attitude to one side, we literally had to wait close to 20 minutes to even order our first drink which again showed either his lack of understanding in the customer service industry or lack of respect to his patrons. I know he isn't a true representation of this establishment because of the many other great reviews but when youre spending hundred of dollars on a meal, the environment and service should be a solid part of the package and this was lacking. I have been to nearly 8 restaurants over my vacation here in Seattle and this guy ruined what would be an amazing 5 star place. Would not recommend to friends or family."

My wife and I were really looking forward to going and we thought it was a bit of a classy place, judging by the website. Turns out, it's not. Luckily for us, we got to sit inside, but the tables outside all had plastic picnic type table cloths. The restaurant is located in an alley and it fits in with the Public Market scene, but definitely not with the classy scene that it portrays on the website. The food wasn't that great either, ESPECIALLY for the price we paid. I had the spaghetti, which came with no garlic bread or anything and my wife had the steak, which was more bone than actual meat. The main reason we wanted to go was for the trapeze artist, which was supposed to be performing from 6:30-9PM, so I made our reservation for 6:30PM. The whole hour and a half that we were there, she performed for 2 songs. That's it! The trapeze artist isn't something that should be advertised if she isn't going to perform. Overall, I definitely won't be returning to The Pink Door. It's just not worth the money. It's nothing spectacular."

While my experience had its highlights, there were a few aspects that left me wanting more.Let's start with the positives. The service at The Pink Door was exemplary. From the moment I stepped through the pink-hued entrance, the staff greeted me with warm smiles and made me feel welcome. They were attentive, knowledgeable, and ensured that my dining experience was smooth and enjoyable. Kudos to the staff for their exceptional service!The drink selection at The Pink Door was a true delight. The bar is well-stocked and the mixologists behind it know their craft. I tried a couple of their signature cocktails, and each one was expertly crafted, bursting with unique flavors and beautifully presented. If you're a fan of creative libations, The Pink Door will not disappoint.Now, onto the food. While the dishes at The Pink Door were undeniably well-prepared, I found them to be on the pricier side. It's true that quality ingredients and a skilled culinary team come at a cost, but I couldn't help but feel that the prices were a tad steep for what was served.Specifically, the pasta, often hailed as an Italian staple, left me somewhat underwhelmed. While it was cooked to a perfect al dente texture, the flavors fell slightly short of my expectations. The dishes lacked that extra oomph that elevates a good pasta to a memorable one. Perhaps a bit more attention to seasoning and innovative flavor combinations would enhance the overall dining experience.Despite these shortcomings, The Pink Door does possess its fair share of merits. The attentive service and the remarkable drinks are definite highlights that shouldn't be overlooked. However, I would encourage the restaurant to refine their flavors and consider adjusting their pricing to offer better value for the culinary experience they aim to provide.In summary, The Pink Door is a decent Italian restaurant with good service and amazing drinks. While the food may be a bit expensive and the pasta lacks a little bit of flavor, it's still a place worth visiting if you're in the mood for a charming atmosphere and attentive service."

The cocktails were on the lower end of OK. The food was good, not great. The whole thing was just OK. I think if the hostess had seemed happy we were there, it would have started us on a better track. We wouldn't go back, but I guess it's worth one visit."

Hidden in an alley near Pike Market and only identifiable by their signature pink door, this restaurant feels like stepping into an old vaudeville theater. When we went, there was a live band with an amazing vocalist playing blues/Americana music. The pasta was good but the dishes could've used more sauce that was a consensus from all. The prices are affordable that's for sure. We stayed for a few hours, enjoyed the food, atmosphere, jazz band and company. The service could've been quicker but the waitress was extremely nice and knowledgeable. There's no reason why I wouldn't go back."

We found it by chance and it really does have a nondescript pink door. But when you walk inside, you get the feeling of warmth, history and elegance. The food was fantastic and they easily accommodated my no grain eating challenges. Their house infused olive oil was out of this world. We had filet of sole and a butternut squash risotto with shrimp. Could not have been better. We wanted to keep eating because it was so good but were full! Wait staff was friendly and attentive.

The environment was so good with delicious aromas of foods spread all over. Our ordered food was served so well and it was so appealing to my taste buds. Our server was very friendly. He gave us the details of all the dishes and so it was easy to decide then.

Had the lobster ravioli and the eggplant pasta for course. The administration was brisk, the server helped us pick sustenance. We finished supper on olive oil cake with orange and pomegranate sauce - it was immaculate! Provincial old fashioned feel, the unrecorded music after some time just develops the air! PS: Ask for the seat by the window, you may very well get it as we did ! :)"

These are pretty rare, but it's definitely worth spending one on the Pink Door's elevated patio. In fact, make an evening of it by putting on that swooshy little dress you paid too much for and a spritz of expensive perfume. I love their wild mushroom risotto and they make a damn good caesar too. Of course you will enjoy a glass of wine or other pretty drink, and your companion will find you enchanting."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=140,Jay R.,4.0,5/25/2018,2,CA,So Good!That's all that i really want to add. So suck it up.

The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=160,Shay L.,4.0,11/1/2017,7,WA,One of most vintage and collectively put together restaurants I have been to in Seattle. The simple but elegant aesthetic adds a nice touch to the vibe and provided my time there with relaxing energy. I indulged in the spaghetti with meatballs and enjoyed the simplicity in the flavors.Everything blended well and gave my palled a sweet but organic dance. The pricing is far and if you have dessert you're only coming out of your pocket about 40$. HIGHLY recommended!!!!
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=160,Jan Q.,4.0,10/23/2017,141,CA,"Amazing experience. Delicious food. Great service. Long wait(didn't have a reservation), WORTH THE WAIT."

We started with the cheeseboard and it was the perfect start to the meal. I had the Linguine alle Vongole and the clams were so fresh it was one of the best linguine's I've had. My partner had the Lasagna, which he said was amazing. We were really pleased with this restaurant and definitely plan to come back on our next trip to Seattle."

Small jazz band trio was play on a Tuesday night. Loved the food and creative drink menu. We went back on another night since we liked this place so much. I also learned that they have acrobats that work the indoor swings on some evenings for added entertainment.

I came here and had the grilled Caesar salad and it's hands down the most delicious plate I've ever had. It was so good I couldn't even wait to take a picture. I also ordered the tuna tartare and shared the red sauce pasta! I'm so pleased with the quality of the food here. We also bought a bottle of Sangiovese and it was on point. Classy feel, classy restaurant! Such a great experience!!"

I eagerly asked our waitress for more bread so I can lap it all up. My girlfriend ordered the risotto which was so craftily made and had such exquisite flavor and wasn't overcooked nor undercooked but just right. For dessert we got the apricot and strawberry crumble which was too sweet, but thank god we had some ice cream to tone it down."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=170,Shawna R.,4.0,8/4/2016,10,CA,"Excellent spot for a cocktail and a great atmospheres. Traveled here with some friends and this place was recommended by the hotel concierge and once we got there we knew why. Excellent selection and the bartenders knew what they were doing. They were very knowledgable and didn't have to stick to the menu, they offered to make anything with any individual ingredients that you like. Step right in and enjoy"

I 'd been here once before, and had an excellent experience, so I convinced the group to check it out. As before, there was an accordion group, which totally rocked (we lucked out and got a table close to the stage). I went with the chilly dungeness crab dish, and between the four of us, we killed two bottles of wine, and totally enjoyed ourselves. Everyone adored their plates too, and the desserts were divine. Highly recommended."

Undoubtedly one of these areas which makes you feel as if you have finally found the city and broken out of the tourist routine, regardless of the closeness to Pike's Place I could not decide between 4 and 5 stars, but it gets five to counter all the whinging."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=170,Jay S.,4.0,3/24/2016,14,WA,"Burlesque, Italian food... what is not to like?!The patio in the back is where all the real action is (weather permitting). Decent views of the water and downtown.They have some vegan options here, which was a nice surprise (I am not Vegas but when going with friends). I am a big fan of the puttanesca.I have only seen the ""show"" once, and it was entertaining but the real star is the food.Its called the Pink door because, other than the pink door, you wouldn't know how to find the joint.The bar across the alley was a great place to go after to continue the celebrations. I am drawing a blank on the name."

All these are quite uncommon, but it is definitely worth spending one on the Pink Door's raised veranda. Actually, make an evening of it by putting on that swooshy small clothing you paid too much for and a spritz of expensive cologne. I really like their wild mushroom risotto and they make a bloody great caesar also. Of course you may appreciate a glass of wine or another pretty beverage, as well as your company will see you enchanting."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=180,Sonya T.,4.0,2/9/2016,5,CA,Coming to this place was an interesting experience with the rustic pink door entrance. Plus knowing it was more of a pub it sort of threw the feel off. All the art on the walls and building was a please surprise and was excited about the whole place.The lasagna was fantastic and given the reviews from everyone else it's no suprise as well. Lasagna with some tabasco sauce makes it even better. Especailly with some heat makes the pallet just open up to bring the favor in that much more.
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=180,Brittany K.,4.0,1/28/2016,2,WA,"Really good food, great for a night out, can get pricey but the food is definitely worth it, in the summer you can sit on the balcony which is a huge plus, parking can be hard to find sometimes due to the prime location."

It was my birthday and my friends wanted something different than the usual so we tried it. Overall the food was good, all of our different wines were wonderful and we liked the atmosphere. We went on a Saturday evening so were able to watch the trapeze act. I'm told that they have 3 different trapeze acts a night but we only saw the first one. A little disappointing but still a unique experience. On Sundays they have a Vaudeville type of show that we haven't seen and may go back for that sometime. One note to others who have not been....there is no sign to indicate where the restaurant is outside. You enter from Post Alley and you must look for a kinda pink door to enter the Pink Door. Guess we should have read the yelp reviews before going :)"

The entertainment can be fun. Their appetizers tend to be on the spot. They have nice hours (good for people who work late and whatnot).Pink Door has been a consistently good spot. The particular highlights have been the pasta and the appetizers. Their pappardelle ragu is great! Most often Pink Door has been delivered via Postmates. It's one of the most solid bets for Italian we've found for delivery."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=190,Crystal N.,4.0,9/9/2015,187,CA,"It's been two months since my friends and I visited The Pink Door and my mouth is still watering whenever I think about how amazing the pesto lasagna was. I never thought a simple looking dish could taste that incredible. It's a must-order. The calamari was excellent as well. We assumed it was the usual deep fried dish but it wasn't. It was a nicely sauteed dish with garlic, tomatoes, spinach and white wine. When you enter through the pink door, you'll be mesmerized by how pretty the place is. It's an ambiance I'd imagine my reception to have if I had a small wedding party. The setting was whimsical, elegant and romantic.The back part of the restaurant has a more laid-back feel and is also where the bar is located! There's also an outdoor seating area - perfect to enjoy a meal with your S/O or friends."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=190,Aj G.,4.0,7/24/2015,6,CA,"You Gotta Go Once... this is one of those places that is the complete experience. Right from the start, the whole idea that there is no sign, just a pink door on an alley, gets you in the theme. It's not that hard to find if you pay attention, and look over the wall and see all the people dining on the deck that hangs over the water with an amazing view. Once inside, it's got that old Seattle brothel dcor, and if you time it right, a trapeze artist twirling around for her 5 minute performance every 30 minutes. If you book online, it's for seating outside. We were there during a rare heatwave, so outside at night was great. Perfect view of the water, the Great Wheel, and a cool statue on the neighbor's balcony next door.The service was good, friendly, attentive, informative. The food was tasty, but my two teenaged sons reported it was not enough food. They both ordered the Pappardelle, which was only that on a plate. I ordered a really juicy piece of freshly caught king salmon, and my husband ordered cioppino. My plate was the tastiest, simple and fresh. The cioppino was good, but neither a brothy soup or a plated dinner, it was somewhere in between.If you somehow book a table inside, it's more crowded, intimate, and entertaining for sure. On Saturdays they have a cabaret show, which is separate from the meal."

Their Cesar sounds so simple but its so good either add the shrimp or the crab. We tried the fish of the day and cioppino. Let me just say Seattle gets down with their see food. This place is always busy and they have live music almost everyday of the week. The entrance in an alley way so its fun to find. Close to Pike Market and Downtown. Very Romantic and from now on will make it a point to dine here every time I come to Seattle."

The menu could of have a few more options, however all the food was good quality. I will for sure take my wife back in the summer for the out door seating our waiter mentioned to us. Slightly over priced so it is more of a special occasion restaurant. Parking around there was hard to find but I guess I have to expect that by pike place."

Pink Door impresses with its thoughtfully crafted dishes and inviting atmosphere. The Ahi Tuna Crudo was fresh and bright and was complemented by fried capers and microgreens, creating a balanced plate with delightful textures and flavors. The Lasagna Pink Door, rich with spinach and perfectly melted cheese, exceeded my expectations despite not being a huge lasagna fan. The Lemon Risotto with Prawns had a bright, lemony taste that wasn't overpowering. The creamy risotto was decadent yet light, while the prawns were large, flavorful, and juicy. For dessert, the Tiramisu was creamy with soft, spongey ladyfingers and a pleasant coffee taste. The Espresso Martini, though smooth and potent, left me wishing for a creamier texture, but that's personal preference. Reservations can be hard to come by, but walk-ups are an option if you're willing to wait. The beautifully decorated interior and attentive, friendly service make Pink Door a charming spot worth the effort to visit."

Our waitress, Krista, did an excellent job recommending meals, appetizers, and drinks. She was attentive, ensuring our waters were always filled, which added to the overall positive experience.The ambiance was wonderfully relaxing, enhanced by a beautiful view of The Sound and West Seattle. The setting alone makes this place worth visiting.Now, onto the food. The lemon risotto is a must-try; it's perfectly balanced and flavorful. The crab and corn salad appetizer is another standout, bringing the freshness of Northwest crab right to your table. However, the oil served with the bread could be improved; it's a bit lacking for dipping six pieces of bread. A little more oil would go a long way.Despite this minor detail, Pink Door is a must-go destination. Just be sure to look for the huge line, as the entrance can be easy to miss.---"

Usually have a great experience. Whoever was the hostess tonight made me never want to return. I walk in at 10:25 to be seated and am told their kitchen closes at 10:30. Which is odd cause I've never been told this especially cause I only order oysters and a few drink around this time and day. Needless to say I won't be back.
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,emily c.,1.0,10/11/2023,1,WA,"I am still reeling from shock of how horribly myself and my family were treated. I, visibly pregnant, was seated at a table with a bench on one side and 2 chairs on the other. My 2yo and 5yo were both sitting with me on the bench side waiting for my husband to arrive. There were 3 other similar tables next to us, all still unseated. The hostess kindly brought us crayons for my children to color on the paper laid across the table. My daughter was coloring, never straying once from our table. My son was guardian of the crayons. On three occasions, my *near 2yo* screamed loudly ""MINE!"" when my daughter went for a crayon. I am well aware this is less than ideal. It is a phase he is in, screeching any time he is excited or mad or expressing emotions. Before and after each of those moments, he was calm and happy and just fine. Each time he did it, I did my best to get him to stop immediately. We had been there all but 10 minutes. The manager, Christopher Fischbach, approached me and said ""You are going to have to reign this in."" I asked ""excuse me?"" And he said ""you are going to have to reign this in. We can't have your children running around and the screaming will have to stop."" I replied that my daughter hadn't left the table once and then asked how he suggest I stop my not yet 2yo son from screaming?"" He said he didn't know. I asked ""and what if I can't? Will we be escorted out?"" And he said ""if it is excessive, maybe so. We have to seat these other tables.""At this point I was so incredulous, I could not believe this was being said to a paying customer, let alone the fact that a child was being targeted. I asked if this was routine for them, he did not reply and he walked away. I still cannot believe this happened. I am appalled. I am ashamed to say that we stayed, but I refuse to be bullied. Yeah, they got my money, but I have my dignity. And I hope Christopher (who, no, does not have children of his own) treats families trying their absolute best with the respect they deserve moving forward. He was a pretty massive disappointment to humanity tonight.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money here. The food was not remotely worth what they lack entirely in service."

As you've probably gathered, my partner is a transgender woman and I fully support/love her, we were eating at the Old Spaghetti Factory in Southcenter when my partner said she felt someone staring at her, I was going to assure her that kno one was staring, however, I was appalled to see this kid working there standing in the kitchen entrance pointing at her, I stared the kid down until he walked away. I immediately asked for the manager, the manager who came over to help us was completely drunk, he asked us if we were sure he was pointing at us, and he offered to pay for our food. This place is a whole bundle of bad memories for us now. Time to go to Cheesecake Factory instead."

Tonight sept 15th 2018 we called and were told we couldn't make a reservation and to just come in. We arrived at 6:50 and were turned away saying that there is no space for us ( there was plenty of space as we could see) We were told there was a burlesque showing going on later in the evening in the back. The lack of communication makes me never want to come here again.
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=10,Melissa S.,1.0,8/18/2018,24,CA,Arrived to the restaurant with reservations to find the menu so offensive with anti-Trump item names. Way to offend patrons who want to support your restaurant. Your employees are mandated to obey the owners political views - no thanks. Never will we support your business. Service was terrible once we expressed being offended.
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=10,Mark W.,1.0,8/1/2018,10,WA,"We made reservations through open table and received excellent seating in the dining room. I have been to the pink door for many many years and for many occasions, however on this particular occasion we were celebrating 2 birthdays. We enjoyed a very nice lunch for two, linguine vongole and the squid ink pasta seafood special.The awkward moment arrived when the server brought us an empty plate with two birthday candles absent of anything except the two candles.We felt as though he presented an ""empty"" birthday wish. I am still dumbfounded by the gesture. Honestly I would have preferred no recognition rather than the empty plate presentation. That was the one star reception we received. My friend had flown in from San Francisco for this luncheon and it was immeasurably disappointing."

The problem was the cost of the food for the quantity and quality. We really went to see the perfomace thinking it would be a fun way to spend dinner. Well the performace is five minutes at best, every 30-45 minutes so don't go for that. The food was way over priced. I spent $44.00 for a small bowl of (premade) gluten free pasta with a bland cream sauce, a butterscotch pudding (which was pretty good) and a glass of water-yes $44!!! . Since I had to eat GF I didn't get bread unless I wanted to pay $3 more for Udi's bread. There were no dinner salads, veggies, meat for my dish or anything else. I hate the Italian Denny's (Olive Garden) but have to say I have had better meals there and for a better price. Felt a bit duped by the allure of a cool performace which is the only reason I was willing to spend that kind of money on pasta only to find out it the performance wasn't really part of the ambiance. Very disappointing."

The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=10,EmmLee W.,1.0,9/16/2013,8,WA,"We planned our meal two months in advance, reserved a table, and hoped to top off the last night of our Seattle vacation with an excellent view, meal and drinks.We were seated on the patio, jammed into a corner but jutting out into the walkway, where we were jostled by staff and other diners. We ordered sodas while taking a moment to look at the wine menu, and decided to share an order of the calamari with spinach. This was okay, a bit overcooked and chewy, but we had high hopes for the meal - I ordered linguine with clams, and my husband ordered clams and mussels.I had one bite of my pasta with clams, and couldn't eat anymore. The pasta was overcooked, but all of that was masked by the amount of sodium in the ""broth"" - you could taste nothing BUT salt, as though a cup of it had been poured into the cooking liquid. The acidity burned my tongue and scoured the inside of my mouth. I couldn't taste or eat properly for two days afterward. My husband's clams and mussels had no seasoning or taste, other than that of steamed and overcooked seafood. No garlic, wine, herbs or anything else. It was as if they'd steamed the shellfish and dumped them in the bowl. Also, no pasta or other sides were served with that dish: $26 or so for a bowl of flavorless steamed mussels and clams. We declined to order something else, and asked for our check. This was the only time in our lives that we've ever walked out of a restaurant. Although the manager comped our soda and calamari, we left a comparable amount on the table for the waitress and staff. We figured they shouldn't be left without the tip they'd have received had the chef and kitchen staff not put out such an embarassing ""meal"". We spent an hour trying to find another restaurant that was open in the area after 9 PM, which oddly enough is not easy to do, especially as we'd walked from our rental to The Pink Door.As far as ambience and staff: the greeter and our waitress were very nice. The place was okay, but other than some cute decoration and a good band, it wasn't exceptional - certainly not enough to balance out the mediocre starter and inedible meal. I can honestly say I'd not recommend this restaurant to anyone."

After reading the rave reviews, I was excited to check it out. I ordered the seasonal Love Fest drink and the spinach pasta lasagna. Both were absolutely delicious--the best lasagna and cocktail I've ever had. Despite it being pretty packed and not having a reservation, the host kindly offered me a seat at the bar. I didn't mind since I was dining solo. The bartender was very friendly and made me laugh as we chatted about San Francisco, my hometown. The ambiance was charming, with a dark yet cozy interior and live music, which was a lovely bonus.Fast forward to my second visit, which was during my birthday weekend on a solo trip to Seattle. I decided to have my birthday dinner at The Pink Door. Unfortunately, this experience was vastly different. I arrived around 8 PM, close to the last call for dinner, so the restaurant was quite empty. Despite this, the host insisted I sit at the bar again, which felt odd since there were plenty of empty tables and I wanted a more traditional dining experience for my birthday. I ordered an orange cocktail (can't remember the name), and while the waitress carded me, she didn't acknowledge my birthday at all. Additionally, my water cup was only refilled by a passing busser rather than my waitress, who seemed inattentive. The lasagna was just as delicious as before, but the service this time was extremely disappointing. It felt like they weren't interested in providing good service during the last call.The food at The Pink Door is amazing, but the service can be hit or miss. They definitely need to improve their service, especially for customers who dine during quieter times."

Our server and the overall service on the other hand was less than subpar and rude at times. I came here with my girlfriend knowing I was going to spend a few hundred dollars and we were taken to our seat and immediately told by our young male server that when he is in our presence we have to put our masks on which I am 100% on board with preventative measures regarding covid however when im in a restaurant sat across from one person while our server is 6ft apart it didn't make sense but we went with it. Putting his unapproachable attitude to one side, we literally had to wait close to 20 minutes to even order our first drink which again showed either his lack of understanding in the customer service industry or lack of respect to his patrons. I know he isn't a true representation of this establishment because of the many other great reviews but when youre spending hundred of dollars on a meal, the environment and service should be a solid part of the package and this was lacking. I have been to nearly 8 restaurants over my vacation here in Seattle and this guy ruined what would be an amazing 5 star place. Would not recommend to friends or family."

My wife and I were really looking forward to going and we thought it was a bit of a classy place, judging by the website. Turns out, it's not. Luckily for us, we got to sit inside, but the tables outside all had plastic picnic type table cloths. The restaurant is located in an alley and it fits in with the Public Market scene, but definitely not with the classy scene that it portrays on the website. The food wasn't that great either, ESPECIALLY for the price we paid. I had the spaghetti, which came with no garlic bread or anything and my wife had the steak, which was more bone than actual meat. The main reason we wanted to go was for the trapeze artist, which was supposed to be performing from 6:30-9PM, so I made our reservation for 6:30PM. The whole hour and a half that we were there, she performed for 2 songs. That's it! The trapeze artist isn't something that should be advertised if she isn't going to perform. Overall, I definitely won't be returning to The Pink Door. It's just not worth the money. It's nothing spectacular."

While my experience had its highlights, there were a few aspects that left me wanting more.Let's start with the positives. The service at The Pink Door was exemplary. From the moment I stepped through the pink-hued entrance, the staff greeted me with warm smiles and made me feel welcome. They were attentive, knowledgeable, and ensured that my dining experience was smooth and enjoyable. Kudos to the staff for their exceptional service!The drink selection at The Pink Door was a true delight. The bar is well-stocked and the mixologists behind it know their craft. I tried a couple of their signature cocktails, and each one was expertly crafted, bursting with unique flavors and beautifully presented. If you're a fan of creative libations, The Pink Door will not disappoint.Now, onto the food. While the dishes at The Pink Door were undeniably well-prepared, I found them to be on the pricier side. It's true that quality ingredients and a skilled culinary team come at a cost, but I couldn't help but feel that the prices were a tad steep for what was served.Specifically, the pasta, often hailed as an Italian staple, left me somewhat underwhelmed. While it was cooked to a perfect al dente texture, the flavors fell slightly short of my expectations. The dishes lacked that extra oomph that elevates a good pasta to a memorable one. Perhaps a bit more attention to seasoning and innovative flavor combinations would enhance the overall dining experience.Despite these shortcomings, The Pink Door does possess its fair share of merits. The attentive service and the remarkable drinks are definite highlights that shouldn't be overlooked. However, I would encourage the restaurant to refine their flavors and consider adjusting their pricing to offer better value for the culinary experience they aim to provide.In summary, The Pink Door is a decent Italian restaurant with good service and amazing drinks. While the food may be a bit expensive and the pasta lacks a little bit of flavor, it's still a place worth visiting if you're in the mood for a charming atmosphere and attentive service."

Hidden in an alley near Pike Market and only identifiable by their signature pink door, this restaurant feels like stepping into an old vaudeville theater. When we went, there was a live band with an amazing vocalist playing blues/Americana music. The pasta was good but the dishes could've used more sauce that was a consensus from all. The prices are affordable that's for sure. We stayed for a few hours, enjoyed the food, atmosphere, jazz band and company. The service could've been quicker but the waitress was extremely nice and knowledgeable. There's no reason why I wouldn't go back."

The food was fantastic and they easily accommodated my no grain eating challenges. Their house infused olive oil was out of this world. We had filet of sole and a butternut squash risotto with shrimp. Could not have been better. We wanted to keep eating because it was so good but were full! Wait staff was friendly and attentive.

These are pretty rare, but it's definitely worth spending one on the Pink Door's elevated patio. In fact, make an evening of it by putting on that swooshy little dress you paid too much for and a spritz of expensive perfume. I love their wild mushroom risotto and they make a damn good caesar too. Of course you will enjoy a glass of wine or other pretty drink, and your companion will find you enchanting."

The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=160,Shay L.,4.0,11/1/2017,7,WA,One of most vintage and collectively put together restaurants I have been to in Seattle. The simple but elegant aesthetic adds a nice touch to the vibe and provided my time there with relaxing energy. I indulged in the spaghetti with meatballs and enjoyed the simplicity in the flavors.Everything blended well and gave my palled a sweet but organic dance. The pricing is far and if you have dessert you're only coming out of your pocket about 40$. HIGHLY recommended!!!!

We started with the cheeseboard and it was the perfect start to the meal. I had the Linguine alle Vongole and the clams were so fresh it was one of the best linguine's I've had. My partner had the Lasagna, which he said was amazing. We were really pleased with this restaurant and definitely plan to come back on our next trip to Seattle."

Small jazz band trio was play on a Tuesday night. Loved the food and creative drink menu. We went back on another night since we liked this place so much.

I came here and had the grilled Caesar salad and it's hands down the most delicious plate I've ever had. It was so good I couldn't even wait to take a picture. I also ordered the tuna tartare and shared the red sauce pasta! I'm so pleased with the quality of the food here. We also bought a bottle of Sangiovese and it was on point. Classy feel, classy restaurant! Such a great experience!!"

I eagerly asked our waitress for more bread so I can lap it all up. My girlfriend ordered the risotto which was so craftily made and had such exquisite flavor and wasn't overcooked nor undercooked but just right. For dessert we got the apricot and strawberry crumble which was too sweet, but thank god we had some ice cream to tone it down."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=170,Shawna R.,4.0,8/4/2016,10,CA,"Excellent spot for a cocktail and a great atmospheres. Traveled here with some friends and this place was recommended by the hotel concierge and once we got there we knew why. Excellent selection and the bartenders knew what they were doing.

I 'd been here once before, and had an excellent experience, so I convinced the group to check it out. As before, there was an accordion group, which totally rocked (we lucked out and got a table close to the stage). I went with the chilly dungeness crab dish, and between the four of us, we killed two bottles of wine, and totally enjoyed ourselves. Everyone adored their plates too, and the desserts were divine. Highly recommended."

Undoubtedly one of these areas which makes you feel as if you have finally found the city and broken out of the tourist routine, regardless of the closeness to Pike's Place I could not decide between 4 and 5 stars, but it gets five to counter all the whinging."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=170,Jay S.,4.0,3/24/2016,14,WA,"Burlesque, Italian food... what is not to like?!The patio in the back is where all the real action is (weather permitting). Decent views of the water and downtown.They have some vegan options here, which was a nice surprise (I am not Vegas but when going with friends). I am a big fan of the puttanesca.I have only seen the ""show"" once, and it was entertaining but the real star is the food.Its called the Pink door because, other than the pink door, you wouldn't know how to find the joint.The bar across the alley was a great place to go after to continue the celebrations. I am drawing a blank on the name."

All these are quite uncommon, but it is definitely worth spending one on the Pink Door's raised veranda. Actually, make an evening of it by putting on that swooshy small clothing you paid too much for and a spritz of expensive cologne. I really like their wild mushroom risotto and they make a bloody great caesar also. Of course you may appreciate a glass of wine or another pretty beverage, as well as your company will see you enchanting."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=180,Sonya T.,4.0,2/9/2016,5,CA,Coming to this place was an interesting experience with the rustic pink door entrance. Plus knowing it was more of a pub it sort of threw the feel off. All the art on the walls and building was a please surprise and was excited about the whole place.The lasagna was fantastic and given the reviews from everyone else it's no suprise as well. Lasagna with some tabasco sauce makes it even better. Especailly with some heat makes the pallet just open up to bring the favor in that much more.
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=180,Brittany K.,4.0,1/28/2016,2,WA,"Really good food, great for a night out, can get pricey but the food is definitely worth it, in the summer you can sit on the balcony which is a huge plus, parking can be hard to find sometimes due to the prime location."

The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=180,Katie S.,4.0,11/12/2015,7,WA,"I have lived in the Seattle area for quite some time yet had never been to the Pink Door. It was my birthday and my friends wanted something different than the usual so we tried it. Overall the food was good, all of our different wines were wonderful and we liked the atmosphere. We went on a Saturday evening so were able to watch the trapeze act. I'm told that they have 3 different trapeze acts a night but we only saw the first one. A little disappointing but still a unique experience. On Sundays they have a Vaudeville type of show that we haven't seen and may go back for that sometime. One note to others who have not been....there is no sign to indicate where the restaurant is outside. You enter from Post Alley and you must look for a kinda pink door to enter the Pink Door. Guess we should have read the yelp reviews before going :)"

The entertainment can be fun. Their appetizers tend to be on the spot. They have nice hours (good for people who work late and whatnot).Pink Door has been a consistently good spot. The particular highlights have been the pasta and the appetizers. Their pappardelle ragu is great! Most often Pink Door has been delivered via Postmates. It's one of the most solid bets for Italian we've found for delivery."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=190,Crystal N.,4.0,9/9/2015,187,CA,"It's been two months since my friends and I visited The Pink Door and my mouth is still watering whenever I think about how amazing the pesto lasagna was. I never thought a simple looking dish could taste that incredible. It's a must-order. The calamari was excellent as well. We assumed it was the usual deep fried dish but it wasn't. It was a nicely sauteed dish with garlic, tomatoes, spinach and white wine. When you enter through the pink door, you'll be mesmerized by how pretty the place is. It's an ambiance I'd imagine my reception to have if I had a small wedding party. The setting was whimsical, elegant and romantic.The back part of the restaurant has a more laid-back feel and is also where the bar is located! There's also an outdoor seating area - perfect to enjoy a meal with your S/O or friends."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=190,Aj G.,4.0,7/24/2015,6,CA,"You Gotta Go Once... this is one of those places that is the complete experience. Right from the start, the whole idea that there is no sign, just a pink door on an alley, gets you in the theme. It's not that hard to find if you pay attention, and look over the wall and see all the people dining on the deck that hangs over the water with an amazing view. Once inside, it's got that old Seattle brothel dcor, and if you time it right, a trapeze artist twirling around for her 5 minute performance every 30 minutes. If you book online, it's for seating outside. We were there during a rare heatwave, so outside at night was great. Perfect view of the water, the Great Wheel, and a cool statue on the neighbor's balcony next door.The service was good, friendly, attentive, informative. The food was tasty, but my two teenaged sons reported it was not enough food. They both ordered the Pappardelle, which was only that on a plate. I ordered a really juicy piece of freshly caught king salmon, and my husband ordered cioppino. My plate was the tastiest, simple and fresh. The cioppino was good, but neither a brothy soup or a plated dinner, it was somewhere in between.If you somehow book a table inside, it's more crowded, intimate, and entertaining for sure. On Saturdays they have a cabaret show, which is separate from the meal."

Their Cesar sounds so simple but its so good either add the shrimp or the crab. We tried the fish of the day and cioppino. Let me just say Seattle gets down with their see food. This place is always busy and they have live music almost everyday of the week. The entrance in an alley way so its fun to find. Close to Pike Market and Downtown. Very Romantic and from now on will make it a point to dine here every time I come to Seattle."

The menu could of have a few more options, however all the food was good quality. I will for sure take my wife back in the summer for the out door seating our waiter mentioned to us. Slightly over priced so it is more of a special occasion restaurant. Parking around there was hard to find but I guess I have to expect that by pike place."

Everything was great. But I got the lasagna which was delicious but small and I was still hungry after. The rigatoni with mamas meatballs was delicious but more on the Al dente side than we wanted. The meatball I thought it was just ok. But it's a popular dish. And the rose hips to my lips was really sweet but tasty.

Pink Door impresses with its thoughtfully crafted dishes and inviting atmosphere. The Ahi Tuna Crudo was fresh and bright and was complemented by fried capers and microgreens, creating a balanced plate with delightful textures and flavors. The Lasagna Pink Door, rich with spinach and perfectly melted cheese, exceeded my expectations despite not being a huge lasagna fan. The Lemon Risotto with Prawns had a bright, lemony taste that wasn't overpowering. The creamy risotto was decadent yet light, while the prawns were large, flavorful, and juicy. For dessert, the Tiramisu was creamy with soft, spongey ladyfingers and a pleasant coffee taste. The Espresso Martini, though smooth and potent, left me wishing for a creamier texture, but that's personal preference. Reservations can be hard to come by, but walk-ups are an option if you're willing to wait. The beautifully decorated interior and attentive, friendly service make Pink Door a charming spot worth the effort to visit."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=250,Eli T.,5.0,8/1/2024,152,CA,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Pink Door in Seattle, and it was an exceptional experience. Our waitress, Krista, did an excellent job recommending meals, appetizers, and drinks. She was attentive, ensuring our waters were always filled, which added to the overall positive experience.The ambiance was wonderfully relaxing, enhanced by a beautiful view of The Sound and West Seattle. The setting alone makes this place worth visiting.Now, onto the food. The lemon risotto is a must-try; it's perfectly balanced and flavorful. The crab and corn salad appetizer is another standout, bringing the freshness of Northwest crab right to your table. However, the oil served with the bread could be improved; it's a bit lacking for dipping six pieces of bread. A little more oil would go a long way.Despite this minor detail, Pink Door is a must-go destination. Just be sure to look for the huge line, as the entrance can be easy to miss.---"

The clam pasta and grilled whole fish were amazing. Green salad and antipasto were great. Service was friendly and we were well treated. The only thing that didn't meet my expectation was the chairs. They were too high for the tables so you tend to bend your back while having food.

An old speakeasy (or so the story goes) turned restaurant. It's in an alley and there's no sign, just literally a pink door. You walk in and you're at the top of a staircase overlooking the restaurant. There's often live music and one time I saw an aerial artist performing during our dinner. The food is mostly Italian fare. I usually get a fish dish like Ahi tuna or halibut and a Caesar or kale salad. Having lived in Japan, I'm very picky about my fish, and the fish I've had here has always been fresh. Tables in the back have a great view of the water. On sunny summer days you can eat on the patio. I recommend for a romantic dinner, a business lunch or a gathering of adult friends or family."

We ordered two dishes, the Squid Ink Tonnarelli and the Lasagna Pink Door, and both were outstanding. The Squid Ink Tonnarelli was perfectly cooked and had a deliciously unique flavor. The pasta was infused with squid ink, which gave it a slightly briny taste that complemented the breadcrumbs in the dish. The Lasagna Pink Door was equally impressive. It was layered with rich, Bolognese sauce and creamy, making every bite melt in my mouth. We also ordered the Brussels sprouts side dish, which was a standout in its own right. The sprouts were roasted to perfection with a slightly crispy exterior, and the addition of bacon and balsamic vinegar added a wonderful depth of flavor. It was the perfect side dish to accompany our mains. To accompany our meal, we ordered the It Feels Right cocktail and The Pink Door mocktail, both of which were delicious and complemented our dishes perfectly. The It Feels Right cocktail was a refreshing blend of spirits and fruit juices, while The Pink Door mocktail was light and refreshing, making them the perfect complement to our rich and flavorful dishes.The atmosphere of the restaurant was charming and cozy, with the decor adding to the ambiance. Service was impeccable too - our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Overall, I highly recommend The Pink Door for a special dining experience. The food is exceptional, and the atmosphere is perfect for a romantic date or a night out with friends."

Everything we ordered was spot on. Here's a few we especially loved:1. Pink Door Caesar- this had fresh Dungeness Crab and their dressing was slightly different from the usual which we really loved! 2. Pink Door Lasagna- definitely not your typical lasagna - this one is vegan. The pasta layers are thinner than usual, probably using homemade pasta and we're living for those thin layers!! The flavors on here were also bomb. I just wished the pasta was a bit more al dente or firm but still, really good.3. Ahi Crudo- you really can't go wrong with fresh tuna!! We ended up dipping our bread in the sauce afterwards too cause it was so refreshing. Wish it came in a bigger serving for the price paid, but still good.4. White Chocolate Pound Cake Panini- it looks like a savory dish, but this actually makes use of pound cake as the slices with marshmallow and some crunchy things in between. This was my first time seeing dessert made this way, and I loved it. It was quite sweet though, so get this to share! 5. Squid Ink Tonnarelli- generous serving of pasta and shrimp! The pasta was perfectly al dente and the flavors were spot on.SERVICE: their servers were not very welcoming - they never smiled, never made small talk but they were very much efficient. Our glasses of water were never empty."

I definitely want to come back for when there's a show.

I walked in at 11:25 (yes, they opened early!) and was seated by the window, at my favorite spot. I started with a glass of the house white, served in a little green bottle and small tumbler. The bread arrived almost immediately, along with a little bottle of olive oil. I ordered the 1/2 antipasto, roasted beet salad and rigatoni with grilled sausage. Now that is some good Italian comfort food, served in the most beautiful setting imaginable. Thanks Pink Door for being my ""go to"" spot for ANY occasion!"

We were seated immediately in the back room and decided on a bottle of The Dissident from the Mark Ryan Winery (priced at $65). It was delicious and an amazing red blend. Worth it - plus it was date night, so why not! We split the Caesar salad with fennel dusted croutons and it tasted amazing. We also got Mama's Meatballs which were delicious and was accompanied by a super flavorful marinara. For our main courses we both decided on their two specials. The NW Fish of the Day was a pan-seared halibut with black lentils, roasted carrots, and an arugula and shaved fennel salad. \The other special was squid ink pasta cioppino style with a spicy marina. IT WAS FANTASTIC. The noodles tasted fresh and soaked in all of the well-developed spicy sauce and the seafood was cooked perfectly. It was a bit pricey with the bottle of the wine and two appetizers, but it was well worth it and I will definitely be back again. Highly recommend it!"

It's a bit dark in there with the minimal lighting so it really feels like you're alone with you're party or significant other. My girlfriend brought me here the other day and we had a wonderful time enjoying the rosiotto pasta. There is entertainment as well which we didn't really expect even though she knew more about it than me. Our waiter was very helpful and knowledgable when picking wines for our dessert (which was also to die for). In conclusion I would highly recommend going here on a thursday night to get the full experience.

Its our wedding anniversary. I checked out a bunch of restaurants ahead of time and decided on The Pink Door due to it's combination of romantic decor, reasonable price and great food reviews.I was mildly worried about some of the comments regarding rude servers and such but figured it was still the best bet in town.After a long day running all over the Pike Place market, we arrived for dinner at 6:30. We were promptly seated and for the life of me can't remember our waiters name. He was extremely polite and had the specials down pat. I ended up ordering the spinach lasagna while my husband had the spaghetti and meatballs. Our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and we began to enjoy our meal.After just a few bites, a busser working near our table dropped a water glass which shattered all over the floor. As far as we could tell, none of it hit us or the table next to us so we continued our meal. Almost immediately another female employee came up and asked us if we were ok and if any glass had gotten in our food. We told her that it didn't but she insisted on having the food remade just in case. We told her we understood and she removed the old food. Our waiter showed up at the same time and was also concerned about our welfare.A short while later our new food arrived and everything was great. When we went to pay, our waiter brought the check and explained that both our entrees were on the house due to the accident. I told him that wasn't necessary but was greatly appreciated.I just wanted to say a special thanks to all the employees who helped us for making a memorable anniversary. We will definitely be back to The Pink Door on our next anniversary..."

I discovered it four years ago when looking for a good Italian place near work (I was at Macy's at the time) and found this place on yelp. I called ahead and they weren't busy so I thought I would stop by. Boy was I impressed. To this day, not even a home cooked lasagna by mom could satisfy my craving for what they make. Since that day I have taken friends who all have loved the food and service, and have come alone. I find the patio to be a wonderful place to enjoy a nice glass of wine and a good book. I also promised myself that night that someday I would have a boyfriend who would take me there on a date. We've been together for two years now, have a five month old daughter, and are now engaged. And he and I have been there together twice now."

Dry mix mala noodles come out hot and watery, it's funny to call it ""mala"". Popcorn Chicken with Honey Mustard... All in all, this was the top seller among the many Biang Biang-style noodle joints across the country.(original)The service was quick and good, but the food left much to be desired. The dry mix mala noodle turns out to be lukewarm water, and it is called ""mala"" and spoken. The popcorn chicken was served with martyr's heads... Overall, these are the highest-grossing of all Biang-style noodle joints to visit across the country."

While the wait time after ordering was a bit lengthy, clocking in at 25 minutes for a bowl of noodles, the taste was okay, though not particularly surprising. Unfortunately, the Popcorn Chicken didn't live up to expectations; it's definitely not recommended as it didn't taste like it was supposed to.To add to the disappointments, my Mike tea never arrived, but the server promptly addressed it by removing it from the bill. Getting water refilled proved challenging, possibly due to a busy time and a shortage of servers during the shift. Despite these drawbacks, the server's attentiveness in handling issues and the acceptable noodle taste make me consider giving Biang Biang Noodle another chance, hoping for improvements. Three stars for now."

The service was impressively fast - my order arrived almost as soon as I sat down, which was great! The pork options, especially in the noodles, were really flavorful and tender, adding a nice savory depth to the dish.The soup, though, could have used a bit more kick. I was hoping for a little more spice to balance the richness of the broth. And while the noodles were delicious and freshly made, the prices felt a bit on the higher side for a casual spot. Still, Biang Biang left me satisfied, and I'd happily return for another round - maybe next time I'll ask for extra spice!"

They are delightfully chewy, clearly hand-pulled, and fresh. The mala flavor is executed perfectly, making these dishes truly outstanding. While I would pass on the dumplings, I personally lean towards the soup dishes over the dry ones, as the latter can sometimes be a bit too dry. Nonetheless, it's quite a challenge to find a noodle place with a better texture than this."

Honestly the price point wasn't my favorite part of trying this lil bao, but in all honesty, I'd come back to try the noodles rather than the bao. I think it would be more worth it, after seeing my friends eating their noodle dishes while I was eating a bao... Anyways, that's besides the point-- I'd come here for the nice atmosphere and good food, but not really if I was on a budget."

The place was bustling, with only two servers handling the crowd. I had to wait between 5 to 10 minutes before being seated. Having done my research, I promptly ordered the Mala Spicy Beef Dry Mix, a popular choice among Yelpers. Biang Biang specializes in hand-pulled noodles, known as lamian in Chinese. These noodles are made by repeatedly stretching and folding a piece of soft wheat dough to align the gluten and warm it up. The dough is then rolled out to a workable thickness and cut into portions.The food arrived quickly. Despite being called ""dry,"" the dish wasn't completely dry like Hakka noodles, which is something to keep in mind if you're new to the restaurant. Unlike some Chinese/Vietnamese dishes that might include broth with animal bone marrow or blood, this dry order didn't contain any such elements.The Mala Spicy Beef Dry Mix was delicious and perfectly spiced (I ordered medium spicy). The portion was generous. Despite needing to ask for a fork (I know, sacrilege), I wasted no time digging in.The table service was adequate but not proactive. I had to flag down my server once for the fork and later for a glass of water, both of which were brought promptly.Finding parking in the area can be difficult and expensive. It cost me $6 for an hour of street parking several blocks away from the restaurant.The seating area is not huge, but the tables more closely spaced than in a traditional American restaurant. There appeared to be a flight of stairs leading to an upper level, but I didn't see anyone using it.The prices are competitive, reflecting Seattle's pricey food scene. Overall, I'd not hesitate to return."

Not to mention the food was at our table minutes after we ordered, hot n fresh. You must try the the signature six piece wings, popcorn chicken and signature pork noodle soup (sorry I forgot the exact names). My son really liked checking out the fish tank too. If it wasn't 30 mins away from us we would be here once a week no doubt. Thank you!!!"

We've tried their veg and beef dry noodles, as well as their chicken sandwich. Consistently delicious! The spot is really cute so eventually we'd like to dine in, but for us the issue is parking and we aren't close enough to walk. Highly recommend though!"

I know I was lucky with the street parking and was seated right away. The service was attentive and helpful. The noodles were good and satisfying - long and chewy. I picked the curry dry and loved the flavor. Three of us ordered our own bowls which was a massive amount of food. Next time, I think we will share. We tried the green onion pancake and popcorn chicken. The highlights were the noodle dishes so I'll just stick with those. Especially the tofu or veggie bowl.I really enjoyed my visit and already looking forward to going back. :)"

Wide noodles are genuinely unique, with just the right amount of chewiness. The pork belly is really delicate. A half egg with the proper egg yolk consistency and soy sauce taste is included with the entrees. The noodle meals taste similar to dan dan noodles and feature Szechuan tastes."

I wasn't sure what to order and what the different noodle styles meant. The customer service was great as the cashier explained the different option and the style of the restaurant. It looks really nice. I ordered the cumin lamb dry mix and a crispy chicken bao. My order was done in the time frame I had been given, about 15 minutes. I also really liked how there were chairs outside the restaurant for me to sit and wait since not many places have that right now. The lamb lamb was well portioned and was very flavorful. The crispy chicken boa was delicious. I really enjoyed my experience and will be trying something new off their menu next time I'm in Cap Hill."

We had pushed the food out of our sons reach and were probably taking up one extra seating. Plain simple rude to ask a customer to change seats while in the middle of a meal, completely ruined my appetite and my $70 down the drain!! Addressed issue with manager only to be told that a lie, that the party had a reservation. Never going back again!"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,S M.,2.0,12/6/2019,8,WA,"The food was tasty, but not worth the high prices. Service was friendly but not very attentive."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Nhi H.,3.0,7/30/2021,69,WA,"I was really excited to come here after hearing from the a coworker about their food. I came here one night and knew I had to get the spicy jumbo wings, they good, but just drenched in fish sauce and it was just so heavily breaded that it wasn't much meat underneath. Now don't get me wrong, I can handle my fish suave being that I'm Vietnamese, but this was just too much for me. We also got the shrimp paste grilled on lemongrass stalks and that too was just way too over powering and made it almost too bitter to eat. Over all the decorations were fun and interesting to look at. The cocktails were mediocre. And the wait is always so long, there are better Thai restaurants in the area with no wait and food you can actually enjoy."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Edwiny D.,3.0,5/4/2021,5,WA,Ok the taste was pretty good but the food seemed to be not that fresh. Considering the allure of the restaurant I believe these things matter a lot. The food seems to be a bit uncooked and that made me notice the staleness of the food upon observation. I'll give it a 3/5.

Totally loved it.But why 3 starts?Ordered -Cambodian Salor Kari Sap Curry : isn't exciting as it sounds. This is a Thai food. I could get this at a thai place for much cheaper price. Tastes great though.Price on this item was $20. Yes, you get less than half the portion you expect. Totally overpriced. Im still surprised about the ratings they have on yelp.If you still wanna try, go for it."

Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Patricia A.,4.0,6/25/2023,44,TX,"Nue offers incredibly flavorful food that will leave your taste buds satisfied. However, one major challenge is finding parking in the area. With only parallel parking spots available, and very few at that, it can be a frustrating experience. Another aspect to note is the communal dining setup, where you may find yourself sharing a table with multiple parties, leaving little elbow room. This can make it difficult to fully enjoy the delicious food without being cautious of bumping into other patrons or accidentally knocking something over. That being said, the fried chicken wings are a standout item on the menu, with a delightful fish sauce that adds an extra layer of flavor. On the other hand, the Vietnamese iced coffee may be a bit too sweet for some tastes. While the portions at Nue are satisfying, it's worth mentioning that the menu prices are on the higher side for the area and ambiance. Lastly, the staff's service is decent, but nothing particularly noteworthy."

They have food from all over the world and even some wacky Thai Water Beetles! Not for me but my friends have them a try and stated they were simply salty. The cocktails weren't that great: the food the strong-suite of this place in my opinion. I couldn't really taste the lime or star anise in my drink, it was just like spiked pineapple juice."

We really appreciated the food. The two starters were fantastic!The goat curry was missing a bit of salt, I think. But it can happen when cooking constantly, and it is subjective taste. Very easy to resolve. Service was quick. Most of the staff was friendly and polite. Very positive experience."

So convenient and will definitely use again. Good job. Will be calling again real soon. However consider creating a website or an app that will make contacting you guys much more convenient as compared to calling in order to place an order. An app will go in getting more customers for the premises since the app will be available on several platforms and hence easy for the people to download it. Similarly a website will help to advertise the business as well as the services that are offered as well as any other information that might be considered relevant to the customer.

The diverse menu offered a culinary journey through various flavors. I couldn't help but smile when I spotted Tocilog on their menu, and naturally, I had to order it.The Filipino Tocilog was accompanied by a delightful dipping sauce. The tocino slices were tender, and the egg was perfectly fried to a crisp. The Israeli Shakshuka was expertly cooked and seasoned. Lastly, the Tower of Chengdu Wings provided a satisfying crunch and a hint of spice. The distinct flavors of fish sauce, lime, and peppercorn were unmistakable. The presentation was impressive. All of this was complemented by a glass of ""Less Mosa.""The ambiance of the place is cozy and eclectic, and the service was outstanding. Without a doubt, NUE is a restaurant I'd consider for brunch or dinner when in Capitol Hill."

Von's 1000 Spirits is an American restaurant with an all scratch kitchen specializing in Seattle Sourdough & the largest collection of fine spirits in the cityWe each ordered a burger and were highly impressed. The bun was soft and fluffy, patties homemade, and reminded me of mom & pop shop burgers I would eat as a kid in Pasadena (Lucky Burgers, anyone?) The waiters were all extremely nice and the place was packed! However the vibe still felt intimate. Here are the two types of sandwiches we orderedDouble Smashed American Burger - two prime beef patties, American cheese, caramelized onions, packed dills, lettuce, and some magical sauce"

Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,JoAnna J.,5.0,6/28/2023,6,WA,Great flavors and unique dishes! Cannot wait to taste all the robust flavors still to come.
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,Mr F.,5.0,3/25/2023,24,WA,"I've been to this place at least 15 times in the last year and I would eat there every day if I could. It's my go to answer whenever anyone asks me where I want to eat. It's also a great date spot. ;)The flavors here are incredible. I can't get enough of the hummus, kale & carrot salad, fresh potato frites, and roti. I generally don't like brussels sprouts but they're my favorite item on Nue's menu. I usually ask them to bring out the pineapple cornbread near the end since it's best when warm, and all their desserts are delicious too."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,Helen J.,5.0,9/9/2022,9,WA,"This restaurant lives up to the eclectic vibe. It's unique in every aspect. Their take on fried chicken is like none you've ever had. The barbecue ribs are a must, slow-cooked to perfection. The meat fell off the bone with every bite. All in all, it was a solid experience."

Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=50,Kelly G.,5.0,8/14/2019,7,WA,Awesome food in an environment that transports you to another continent. Delicious and creative without being weird or over self indulgent.
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=50,Heather D.,5.0,8/14/2019,2,WA,"Inventive food. Warm, community-creating environment. Honest, work-their-a**es-off owners and staff. One of my favorite Nue memories has been joining their One-World dinner featuring Syria. Not only were we exposed to delicious food (which, of course, we'd never tried before), but we dined with several Syrians, many of whom were recent refugees. It felt more like someone's home than a restaurant. Thanks, Nue, for enabling me to break (damn good) bread with people I never would have otherwise had the chance to meet."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=50,Phi N.,5.0,8/14/2019,2,GA,"Nue is hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle. It's vibey, and the food is delicious, unique, and colorful. The cocktail menu is fun too. Also, don't forget to try the Thai water beetles!"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=50,Svetlana G.,5.0,8/14/2019,6,WA,"I love Nue and I really mean it. The food is amazing and of awesome quality but, most importantly, it's such a cozy place! On the other note, we had a first date with my future husband there so it will always have a special place in my heart"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Elizabeth S.,5.0,8/14/2019,3,WA,"Nue is a unique restaurant in Seattle, and it's worth a trip to Capitol Hill from the 'burbs if you haven't already tried it. It's a small, locally-owned business and the owners travel the world to find new and delicious international street food dishes for their menu, so there's often something new to discover. I'm not an adventurous eater but my husband is, and there's always something there for both of us.The dining room is an intimate setting with decor sourced from all over. Great date-night place in a classy, relaxed setting with international flair. It's also been fun to see it featured on several food TV shows!"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Jannavie C.,5.0,8/14/2019,8,WA,This place has such a great variety of food from all cultures! I recommend doing family style so that you can try a bunch of different things because everything is delicious! Don't forget to get the tower of wings!!!
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Naveen J.,5.0,6/9/2019,6,IN,One of the few restaurants where you will not be disappointed when you are adventurous
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,K L.,5.0,5/24/2019,15,WA,"Even though one of the things I tasted was a giant bug, this is one of the best places to eat in Seattle! It's like taking a round-the-world tour with someone who's crazy about food. The laphet toke and the Chengdu wings remain favorites of ours. The UN skewers were awesome, especially accompanied by the pineapple cornbread. Their house made ice creams are mind blowing too. The water bugs...well, there was a crazy story that goes along with them, that we were lucky enough to hear firsthand from Chris."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Dave B.,5.0,5/13/2019,1,WA,"I've dined now at Nue twice, and was floored by everything I tried. Having been to many of the countries represented on the menu, I was ready to be disappointed but was impressed by the combination of authenticity and creative spin placed on the food. While I agree it helps to be adventurous (part of the fun eating here), the food is surprisingly accessible. Somewhat randomly, I ended up on a rafting trip on a 4 day rafting trip with Chris Cvetkovich, who owns Nue along with his wife Uyen. We somehow conned Chris to cook for us the entire trip - it was incredible to see him come up with exquisite meals riverside, often improvising with random ingredients from various coolers. More impressive was hearing Chris talk passionately about the people, places, and food he has encountered across the world. Inspiring. I'll be heading back to Nue for the food, but will enjoy it in a new light after spending time with Chris"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Jason W.,5.0,5/9/2019,7,WA,"I don't eat a lot of meat but when I have a fried chicken craving this is the spot for the best wings I have ever had. The presentation on the wings is awe-striking as you are served a massive tower of perfectly golden brown wings. The wings have the perfect amount of flavor and a mouth watering crunch when you bite into them. If you're looking for a lighter accompaniment to your wings, the Brussel sprouts with coconut are delightful. The negative to the restaurant is it is smaller so it can feel cramped. I wish the tables were a little more spread out and there was better sound dampening. That said it's in Seattle, and I'm sure they've done they best they can in order to make a profit. I highly recommend this place as the top spot for wings in the state. Not only that but they also have a really unique menu with other delicious items."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Jasdip S.,5.0,4/28/2019,2,WA,Went for brunch and was blown away. Was absolutely delicious. Will come back again and again.
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Nicole A.,5.0,2/22/2019,5,CA,"Visiting from the Bay Area, I have to say this was the most tasty meal I've had in a long time. The whole vibe is just incredible. It's community seating and that was very different for us but we enjoyed it so much. Thanks for a bomb meal !"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Bill M.,5.0,11/4/2018,14,WA,"I was skeptical because I thought the menu looked like a mess. Nothing seemed connected to me, everything felt like it had a million ingredients. But the food was absolutely delicious. We had the mofongo, Brussels sprouts, and the Syrian kale salad, and pineapple cornbread, and all four were phenomenal. The seating is mostly communal and it's tiny and loud so don't expect ambiance. Other than that, it's fab!"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Carolyn W.,5.0,6/30/2018,13,CA,"Love this place, go hungry be sure to get the chicken wings!"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Erik B.,5.0,6/22/2018,9,WA,"Excellent, unique foods. A sampler of the best food around the world. It is highly unlikely that you have eaten anything that is on the menu. Come willing to try new things. We suggest ordering multiple items and sharing them family style."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Abakum M.,5.0,5/26/2018,3,CA,"My wife and I came to Nue for dinner on Monday night and had our minds blown. The food was so good! We were dying at each bite, gobbling things up, and so happily full afterwards. Our waiter was so attentive and kind! He kept our water refilled, gave excellent suggestions, and had this kind, friendly air that made it seem like he genuinely cared about our experience. It is so hard to find that kind of warmth in restaurants these days and we were super impressed. I cannot wait for the next time I go to Nue, so that I can try their lunch menu.I give Nue 5 stars because everything was great. When you walk in you get that small business family owned feeling and you just know they do their best to give you a great time."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Cheryl L.,5.0,5/3/2018,2,WA,"I was looking for a good breakfast place near my home. Found this on Yelp and it became our official breakfast diner! Went three morning in a row and enjoyed each on of them. The servings are large, the price reasonable and the service efficient. This is not gourmet fare but filling and quick. Line ups each morning but never waited more than 10 minutes. The servers were pleasant and responsive to requests and often constantly moving. Everything we ate was good!"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Gift H.,5.0,7/5/2017,13,WA,So good! The goat curry was so good. Must order McNguyen drink so so yummy! Will be back!
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,ValueKid S.,5.0,3/31/2017,34,OR,I gave new five stars because their service and their staff were excellent. They are gracious and professional. I have the Cuban sandwich which was outstanding. The Mofongo was underwhelming. The communal dining was unexpected but kitschy. I plan to go back.
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Will P.,5.0,2/28/2017,4,WA,The goat curry is great! The Dutch pancakes are great! So many unique dishes!
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Brian C.,5.0,3/23/2016,45,WA,"Really like the concept this place has going. Not an extensive menu, but a very diverse one that emulates international street food. I really enjoyed the Bunny Chow and Jamaican Jerk Chicken, along with the pineapple cornbread. Relatively young crowd gives the place a lively vibe that reflects many Capitol Hill restaurants."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,LanaMarie H.,5.0,2/28/2016,50,WA,Super super good. The pay for parking is totally worth this small menu. The people are A+ nice and friendly
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Rebecca R.,5.0,12/13/2015,6,CA,The jerk chicken is to die for. We also split the bunny chow and octopus skewers--both were full of flavors. We went on a Tues night and was able to get seated right away.

Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=80,Dave W.,5.0,8/14/2015,5,WA,"I'm not exactly what you'd call a ""Professional Yelper"" (this is my first review) but this was seriously the BEST meal I've had in years!I started with the Syrian Kale Salad and Tostilocos. The salad was dressed perfectly and the crunch of the toasted almonds and sweetness of the 'shattered dates' (I still need to figure out how they cut them so damn small) were the perfect textural and flavor counterbalance to the dressing.The Tostilocos were really cool and from what I was told, a pretty common Street Food in Mexico. They consisted of a bag of Mexican, Salsa Verde Tostitos, slit open and stuffed with all kinds of flavors and textures that just worked. Hot sauce, crunchy jicama and cucumber, Tamarind candy, nuts, pickled pork skins, etc. Super fun.I then, based on everyone's suggestions on Yelp, had the goat curry. This dish was over the top, or is it 'off the hook'? I can never keep up with these things. Anyway, super complex dish, just the perfect amount of spicy heat and the sweetness of the coconut cornbread on the side was the bomb (or is it the 'shit'?) I had the McNguyen cocktail which was Vietnamese coffee and Irish Jameson Whiskey shaken over ice. This was one of those drinks that could get a pass just for the clever name but OMG the flavor combo was amazeballs. I'd never tried Vietnamese coffee before, and now need to without whiskey, just to taste the pure flavor of it. After that I need to move back to the one with Jameson though because the combo was fantastic.......and I love whiskeyI was totally full by now but wanted to try their liquid nitrogen ice cream I'd heard about and ordered the French Toast and Bacon Flavor. Without going into too much detail let's just say I'm stopping by after work tomorrow just for another scoop.The service was fantastic and the decor super unique and kitschy but didn't feel contrived. I've been to a lot of bars and restaurants that just hang a couple of taxidermy pieces on the wall wearing hats and call it cool but this place definitely has its own character but still feels real (esp for Capitol Hill)I got a chance to chat a lot with one of the owners (he was my waiter) who mentioned that a lot of stuff on the menu changes all the time. Can't wait to come back and see what's new!!"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=80,Fran C.,5.0,8/9/2015,1,WA,"The rating says as good as it gets and indeed our dining experience at Nue was just that. There were four of us that shared this wonderful food, starting off with unusual and very refreshing non-alcoholic drinks. Than we got down to the real event - beautiful food tastes from around the worlds starting off with what became one of my favorites, a yellow pea salad (Theng Manga Pattani Sundal) -nutty crunchy yellow peas served on grilled romaine and finished with lemon oil. Yum! We then slowly shared and array of dishes from the Grilled Barbados Pig tails that had crispy skin and tender juicy meat with a yummy dipping sauce, Jamacian Jerk Chicken that was tender, juicy and just exploding with flavor to the very satisfying sandwich-The Maracas Shark and Bake.  We ate slow and enjoyed each bite as it arrived one at a time. Great service and good tastes. that's as good as it gets."

I like the small plates -- gave me a chance to sample many flavors & dishes -- sort of like an international version of tapas! The dirty diplomat cocktail was also really awesome.

Sexy atmosphere; candles everywhere. Good looking staff to compliment the interior design, but are they super unprofessional!! They were all ripping shots at the bar, including the manager! My waitress was beyond inebriated and slammed everything down that she gave us. Food was honestly good, except the mussels were past their prime. Crumbled inside of my mouth, so I had to spit it out. I expressed my opinion to the drunken waitress as she responded ""eew, gross"" and ran away. Manager came over to smooth things over, but he just made excuses instead of apologizing- probably thinking about his next shot choice. To make matters worse the FOH employees:A) all were talking about us- they're drunk so they can't control the volume of their voices, again the manager is ring leader in this conversation- so inappropriate and unprofessional. B) sent us out another mussel dish, but I was scarred from the first one so I turned it away.I guess I insulted the line cook? Table was in prime view of the kitchen so I could see him looking at the plate, running his mouth and then he gives me a nasty look. Word of advice to him: don't serve anything you wouldn't eat yourself and don't be in denial of when you send out shitty plates. Beautiful place, some dishes great and some sub par, but they need to pay attention to their daily operations, look at the management more and get a new service team before this place goes downhill! Sorry, just saying! I manage in casual fine dining and this behavior/treatment towards guests, I simply would not stand for."

I normally enjoy myself here a lot, drinking with friends, but the service and food arrival sucks. We all ordered at the exact same time and two of our plates came out first. I didn't want to eat because I felt so awkward. Then the rest of the food came out later after leaving my food in the middle of the table because I felt so awkward. I then asked how long it would take for a bowl of soup to come out so I could eat with them. He said it was only a couple minutes... 20 minutes later I was sitting with no food and the rest of my friends were done eating. I cancelled my soup because if I wanted to eat alone awkwardly I would have done it with the first dish that arrived way too early."

He drove home Mr. G's point about the pretentiousness and pomposity. I, too, notice everyone is a hipster in black---not my kind of crowd, and I enjoy good food, but ambiance is just as important. This, ""I'm from Everett and therefore cannot be pretentious"" is as laughable as the fact that he bothered to respond to the review in the first place!

But is doesn't!Something always goes wrong. Two weeks ago it was a breakfast that came so late that we had to inhale it to get to work on time. And the music was full of tunes that only could be handled with a scotch on the rocks. At 8 in the morning? NOT!Tonight it was two steaks, one so tough that it ruined what was a good flavor. But my wife's medium well steak came with the cow still mooing, and by the time they delivered the overly well done substitute back after we complained, appetite be gone. Evening ruined while she watched the rest of us eat our entries. This place is fine if you're looking for some good looking babes and don't mind the poor service and hit-and-miss food so you can enjoy the eye candy. But the price isn't cheap. So go there for drinks, check out the latest tatoos on the butt of some hard-belly, then get the hell out of there for a burger at Dicks, just a block away. At least you'll get what you expect."

She seemed a little stressed as she took our drink orders, I tried the Madame Toulouse cocktail (excellent) and Joe had a Guinness. For dinner he ordered the Gulf prawns in red basil and was not disappointed. I had the Dungeness Crab with fried green tomatoes. All in all a very good experience and I will try it again. Our server was not having a good night which, of course, can happen to anyone, but she was slow and forget to ask for our second round of drinks. Also, no smile all night. On another night the food and decor would probably have been enough to rate it a four or five, but service led me to rate it 3 stars."

The waiting area has a horrible setup and if it's busy people will crowd in front of the host booth. I was skipped twice while trying to get a table.The waiters were all very friendly. I went for breakfast on a Sunday and I think the food is over priced and with a small portion size, tastes good though.The inside is pretty tacky. It looks like they have sheets stapled to the ceiling to hide the insulation. The ceiling lights look like they were held up by those plant hooks that screw into the ceiling, then plugged into a regular outlet just exposed on the ceiling.I honestly don't know how this place ended up on the Food Network.

The food is consistently tasty, and you can tell that a lot of care and attention is put into the preparation of each dish. The menu is varied, and there are plenty of options to choose from, including some creative twists on classic brunch items.However, one downside is that the coffee leaves much to be desired. If you're a coffee lover, you might be disappointed with the quality of the coffee here. Nevertheless, the quality of the food more than makes up for this minor drawback.Overall, if you're looking for a unique brunch experience that incorporates delicious southern flavors, Toulouse Petit is an excellent choice. The only downside is the wait time, but that's just a testament to how popular and beloved this spot is."
