Today's experience was the icing on the cake where they denied us service at 10.05pm for a 10pm reservation because their ""kitchen was closed"". I cant understand how a restaurant would accept a 10pm reservation but deny entry 5 mins later. And this is when they were accepting reservations till 10.15pm. Thanks for a great friday night - I will never come back again."

Kedai Makan,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kedai-makan-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Nina G.,2.0,3/9/2024,9,NY,"While the lack of takeout was infuriating at the old Kedai, I have gotta say the new one skimps on portion sizes and the out-of-this-galaxy flavor. You literally bought the recipes from the owners, why not stick to them? Take the flavors and portions they pushed out and add takeout - you will see a healthy profit AND a loyal fan base. For now, I'm holding off on this place again until they find the essence of their food, again."
Kedai Makan,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kedai-makan-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Kelly B.,2.0,9/29/2015,49,WA,"What was wrong with the old menu that we all knew and loved? Add drinks and seating, then it would have been perfect. But the new menu is nothing special, unfortunately."
Kedai Makan,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kedai-makan-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Sienna K.,3.0,2/27/2024,3,WA,"What we took away - I wasn't impressed. None of the dishes stood out. Kerabu Mangga - the mix of ripe and semi ripe mangoes in the salad didn't work, i was so excited to order it. The fried rice was too salty to taste on its own. It came with a sweet chilli sauce which was helpful. The pork ribs were good, but they were dry. I had heard good things about this place but maybe we caught them on a bad day."
Kedai Makan,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kedai-makan-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Kaylyn T.,3.0,2/3/2023,1,WA,"The original Kedai Makan was one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle, but the new version is a bit of a disappointment. The new location has its pros (much bigger, almost no wait times, nice ambience) but seems to be missing what the original was known for--fantastic food. While the menu is similar, the quality of the food has gone downhill at the new location and the prices have gone up. The texture of the roti net bread was off, the dhal was super oily and missing the depth of flavor it once had, and the nasi goreng could best be described as ""okay"". The new location might be worth trying for an introduction to Malaysian food, but if you've visited the old, I'm not sure it'll live up to expectations. I was really looking forward to seeing this place come back to life, but I will not be returning."

I really wanted to try this place before they close. Overall, the food was good but just not sure it was worth the hype. I waited in line since 10:30am to put my name down and got a table for 5pm. Their jala was delicious but other vegetarian options were ok. The pudding with longan berries was great!"
Kedai Makan,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kedai-makan-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Edwiny D.,3.0,5/4/2021,5,WA,"They had a variety of dishes but I believe they could cook better. I guess they have to serve a crowd so they do it fast and some out of it remains uncooked. And some part of it was a little burnt assuming it got overcooked a little. They are good on the quantity , have to match up on the quality."
Kedai Makan,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kedai-makan-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Ajay C.,3.0,9/3/2019,395,WA,"A recipe has no soul. The cook must bring soul to recipe. I would say this place partially succeeded in doing the job. I think it's a 3.5*, here is why -Ordered -Kerabu Timun Nanas : cold salad heavily loaded with peanuts and some curry powder I guess. Pineapple and cucumber are my favorite things on this world and this salad ruined it for me.Cocolife : rum, coconut cream and curry powder? Looks interesting right? Tasted like 2/5. Highly not recommended.Roti Jala: sounds like an Indian origin. Best of all the dishes I ordered. If you have tried rice crepes before, roti just tastes like that. Side of dal tasted delicious though.Malay fried peanuts: flavored peanuts that are crispy and tasty.Wait times are crazy, waited close to 1.5hrs. You see more than 4.5*, but honestly I'm not impressed."

They could be more honest about it. In California restaurants will give you a complimentary drink or something. Last time here. There are plenty of good places in Seattle.

Tikka masala chicken katsu was an interesting fusion dish. It was good but not something I feel like i need to get again. I think I like the loco moco with scotch egg more. Seems like their menu rotates though since I didn't see some of the items I saw on yelp on their menu. Food was definitely on the pricier side but maybe thats expected from this being more of a bar? 3.5/5

For a party of two, we definitely ordered more with our eyes, but everything just sounded so good that it was hard not to! We had the oysters, Seattle dog musubi, and loco moco scotch egg. The loco moco scotch egg was actually so filling that I had a good amount of leftovers. Looking forward to returning soon since service was friendly and attentive, and the food was tasty. I still need to try the oxtail risotto and tikka tonkatsu don!Highly recommend making reservations in advance, as the restaurant tends to get full pretty often."

Finding truly authentic Malay food in America can be a challenge, so our expectations were high.Roti Jala: This dish surprised me because I had never tried net bread before. I found the chewy texture to be delightful, and it ended up being my favorite from the meal.Nasi Lemak: The dish was good, and the flavors were quite authentic. However, the sambal didn't quite hit the mark.Rusuk Babi: The ribs were fantastic, tender, but the dish overall was very spicy!In summary, the food was good and reasonably authentic.

While there were some remarkable highlights, a few minor areas held back what could have been a perfect dining experience.First and foremost, the Nasi Lemak was a delightful choice, and opting for the tofu option turned out to be a great decision. The dish was flavorful and authentically prepared, showcasing the kitchen's skill in crafting this Malaysian classic.The Roti Jala with chicken curry was not only very good but also visually appealing. The intricate lace-like pattern of the Roti Jala added an extra layer of charm to the dish, and the accompanying chicken curry was rich and savory.However, the real star of the meal was the Chili Pan Mee. It stood out as the best among the dishes we tried. The flavors were explosive, and the noodles were cooked to perfection, maintaining just the right level of consistency. It's a must-try for those seeking a flavorful punch in their meal.On a positive note, the restaurant honored our check-in and offered us a delightful treat to end our meal: coconut ice cream. It was a pleasant surprise and a perfect conclusion to the dining experience."

I recently tried out the No Wait app to ""get in line"" rather than actually get in line. The only problem is that you can't get in line until the restaurant opens. I used the app 30min after the restaurant opened on a Tuesday evening and still had to wait almost 2 hours to be seated. Plan on getting pre-dinner drinks at the bars around the corner if you decide to come here. The food is always amazing and makes you feel like the wait was worth it. The menu seems to be slightly different every time I visit so I am always trying something new. I recently had some very spicy and crispy chicken wings. the Jala bread was very delicate and almost melted in my mouth with the curry (?) dipping sauce. For my entree, I enjoyed the nashi goering (?). The food is always hot, always delicious, and heats up well the next day for more goodness. While the food is great, service is sub par. Waitors seems to enjoy plenty of relaxed conversations with each other at the bar while my throat is burning since I seem to never have my water refilled...Would very much appreciate a bit more attentive service. The restaurant is always packed and hiring an extra bus boy/water boy would make a huge difference in service."

Last night I had the pleasure of dining here and their food did not disappoint. Soul food classics get a delicious upgrade with fresh local seafood and ingredients. I devoured my seafood boil with a side of greens and can't wait to go back to try some new dishes (they update their menu according to what's fresh in season). I absolutely love the ambiance too.

The bonus meal you get from leftovers are icing on an already delectable cake of carbs, carbs, and more delicious carbs.If you're looking for something extra special (in a unique way, not a you'll-necessarily-like-it way), try the Chinese herb-infused shots.

Adding 20% to the bill WTF??? Oh no, Not giving this to the servers, but pocketing for pure profit. Unscrupulous to wait to the end of the meal to tell us. What's the issue?

He was very rude and stereotyped us right from the start! Told us they weren't taking walk-ins and while we were literally standing right there he offered 4 other people walk-in spots!  He also turned the Asian guy away!  How can he be LBGTQ and still judge people? He should know better about being judged.  Such a shame! If zero stars were an option I would have gladly entered it.

There's no sign about this charge and you'll find out on the receipt when you are paying. You end up paying over 40% to the total when you include gratuity for your server. I'm NOT going back to this restaurant!
Elliott's Oyster House,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/elliotts-oyster-house-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Donna V.,1.0,6/6/2018,1,WA,"While I was dining at Elliot's Oyster House, I witnessed the most appalling scene. Near my table, a man was being interviewed for a serving job. The hiring manager, at a certain point, said to the applicant, ""Look around at the servers. We don't hire your kind here."" The applicant was a black man. The applicant had a friend (maybe partner? unsure) with him who immediately got up to leave. The applicant replied to the hiring manager by saying, ""You can't talk to me like that, sir. That is out of line."" The hiring manager replied with, ""You know what? We don't even like serving your kind here,"" and promptly kicked the applicant and his companion out of the restaurant. I quickly asked for the check and left the restaurant. I don't care how good the food is or isn't, I vow to never support this restaurant again. If I had ever known that they employ racists and ask those racists to hire based on skin color, I never would have set foot in the establishment in the first place. The sheer audacity that a hiring manager felt comfortable having this conversation in the dining area, within earshot of paying customers, is indicative of the kind of insidious racism that can't be pinned on one solitary employee. Elliot's can't do anything to make up for this. I can't imagine what the culture is like in the kitchen, where the line staff is likely entirely composed of people of color. Will never set foot in here again and highly encourage everyone to reconsider spending their money in a place that discriminates against the African American community."

The restaurant is located in a very touristy location, which takes away from the experience. Oysters: The oysters all tasted the same and were not particularly memorable. There are better places for oysters in Seattle. Appetizers: The calamari is frozen, not fresh, which the waitress was forthcoming about when we asked. We did not order it. The crab cakes were fine, but not remarkable. I ordered the Cioppino for the main course. The fish was tough--I did not like the texture and was not sure how fresh the fish was. Bottom line: Save your money for better food and a better atmosphere in a less touristy part of town."

The oysters were fantastic, especially with the awesome toppings they came with. The mussels were great, and the crab cakes were delish. The salmon Caesar was also very tasty.The views from the patio are lovely, which definitely added to our experience. The service, on the other hand, was just okay. It started off pretty slow, and unfortunately, our server forgot to bring the spicy crab & corn chowder we were excited to try. But overall, we still had a good experience!"

Elliott's Oyster House,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/elliotts-oyster-house-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=10,Paul K.,3.0,5/27/2023,47,FL,"We recently dined at Elliott's Oyster House during our Seattle visit and our experience was a mixed bag. Let's start with the beverages - I ordered an Old Fashioned and Amy had a glass of cider. The Old Fashioned was quite disappointing. Note to all restaurants - don't serve this classic cocktail without a single ice cube, it's a major faux pas.We kicked off our meal with an assortment of oysters. It's fascinating how different oysters can taste depending on their origin, and as someone who prefers ones that carry the taste of the sea, this was a treat. The Ahi Tuna Tacos were next - they were perfectly portioned and tasted incredibly fresh.The Seafood Pasta was a hearty and rich dish, with shellfish taking center stage. However, my wife Amy wished there had been more shrimp. The seasonal specialty, a Halibut dish, came served with fresh vegetables and was full of flavor.But here's where things get tricky - Elliott's Oyster House is not easy on the wallet. The prices are quite steep, and to add to that, there's a mandatory 20% service charge added to the bill. The check mentions that part of this charge is shared with the service staff, who are paid a competitive wage. But what's unclear is the exact portion of the service charge that actually goes to the staff. In comparison, other similar establishments often explicitly outline what percentage of the service charge goes to the wait staff. Without this knowledge, customers like us are left wondering if we should tip more and whether the servers are actually benefitting from the service charge. In conclusion, while the food at Elliott's Oyster House is truly wonderful, the service charge practices leave you with an unsavory aftertaste. It's a real pity, as such issues detract from an otherwise great dining experience."

We ordered the clam linguini, the seafood risotto, a couple of the fish a chips, a glass of wine and strawberry lemonade. We all felt the food was very tasty, packed with quality and fresh seafood. A good wine selection allowed for a good glass of wine and the strawberry lemonade was a hit with the kiddo in our party. But for the location, the up an coming newly revamped Seattle water front, this place fell short in terms of style and even cleanliness. The carpet throughout the place is truly done after way too many years of service, and the bathrooms were truly way out of sync with the location, menu prices and reputation of the place. So they loose a star (should have been minus 2 stars but wanted to be more lenient). The bathrooms were for sure fairly dirty, but the food still made up for the decaying ambiance. Hopefully it gets a lift sometime soon. P.S. the staff was welcoming, very nice and efficient.Thanks"

Best part of the whole thing. Better seafood experiences can be found other places with less tourists. But as far as an oyster bar it is perfection.

Smaller than I thought but oh so tasty!! We were a group of 28 so it was a tough order to keep us sorted out and the noise level was a challenge. All in all, the views, location, service and food were as I expected, pricy, above average quality and good service. I would go again for another special occasion. Requesting a quiet corner."

Eating them & then finishing it up with the dessert like Chinook salmon aka King Salmon alder planked prepared medium rare with beurre blanc & the season's fresh vegetables was surely a dessert of its own, as it is seldom noticed as one, whilst finishing sweet down my gullet with Omega 3 oily fats in the finest way possible. If I could see the merry catch hauled off the Puget Sound whilst eating the very catch, bait & shelled crustaceans as they're coming off the boat from the Pacific Ocean, then it would have surely been a more superlative sight to behold, & I may have added another star, so catch that. ;-) Being one of the tourist venues notwithstanding garners it one less star. Just eat, chat with the knowledgeable shuckers & then shlurppp some more, & then what? Then proceed outward bound hastily walking out from Elliott's, which is packed like sardines with the general ill-informed tourist populace popping their heads in here thinking this is THE place where locals go, & then constantly bobbing their heads in disbelief like the buoys you can also see out in the water. :-PGood, attentive service followed by the charging of my phone was even better than the real catch. ;-)"

They had an amazing spread of oysters and delicious food. We split the strawberry and walnut salad and the ciopino. Only reason why not 5 stars is although the food was good, the price was very high. Bread and butter was an extra $5 which seems ridiculous not to include that at a fine dining restaurant when you're asking patrons to pay $35+ per plate not including apps, drinks, etc."

Service the first night, brilliant, I 'd crab and they did the total crab service with the bib, hand washing and all that fun stuff. The second time we had a younger waiter that 'spoke too much"" according my honey. I adored the salmon bisque and the crab (yeah, not overly original). Honey had oysters galore and they were fresh (made me have a flashback to my days as a mermaid) but I actually can not tell the distinct in flavor."

A race to order more before prices hike up every 30 minutes. They seem to have a good selection of local draft beers as well which go well with the oysters!

Those slimy gooey sexy little briny bivalves! OMG. I think the oysters here were definitely the highlight of our self-guided Seattle food and drink tour. Pretty cool little happy hour deal on them too - I think they start at like 75 cents each and then increase every half hour. Unfortunately, we got there at the last half hour, so by that time they were $1.75 each, but damn, they were worth it. And the oyster shucker (oyster tender?) knew a LOT about all of them, giving us samples of his favorites as we dined at the bar. It's a swanky spot for sure, perhaps a bit outside of our swank range, but we sat at the bar with a drink and some happy hour oysters (and other appetizers which were less memorable, including the babiest sized mussels I have ever seen! - slightly disappointing) and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. So I say to you, Yelpers, go there for happy hour. Get there early and fill yourselves with many, many deliciously glistening oysters. They're good for you!"

Elliott's Oyster House,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/elliotts-oyster-house-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=80,Petey O.,4.0,5/13/2011,9,CA,"First stop in must do things in Seattle was the .50 cent oyster HH that runs Monday thru Friday. The way it works is starting at 3pm the HH prices are .50 cents each with a 3 dozen per table limit on the order. If you finish the ones you order you can order more but depending on the currnet time each half hour the price increases by .25 cents. Factors like the time to place the order and have the oysters shucked plus eat time can slow the glutany process down. At 4 when we finally made it there and got a table the price was already $1 per oyster, not terrible but not quite the price we had been shooting for so curse you broken GPS, Seattle freeway system, Seattle parking machines and man who took extra 20 mins at the table which we were waiting for at the bar......Yeah I know better planning should have been happening here but we were dying to try em. We also got $3 beers, oyster shooters and a few other appetizers for $3 each. The Salmon Slider was really awesome in my opinion but the fish taco was just ok. I liked the oyster but I didn't love them and I felt the sizes were not consistent but over all I would love to just stuff myself on .50 cent oysters next visit."

After wandering up and down the pier looking for a restaurant that my friend wanted to go to that he couldn't remember the name of, or where it was, or what it looked like, we settled on Elliot's.The food was great, and the waitstaff was very attentive. We started with the Appetizer Tower, which the waiter seemed a little shocked that we wanted that much food between the two of us for our APPETIZER, but neither of us had eaten anything all day, and hell, we were in for an adventure. I didn't try any of the calamari, but my friend said that it was very good, and I really enjoyed the crab cakes, and the dip was good as well. Ate my appetizers with a very tasty Lemon Drop.For entrees, I had the King Salmon and chips, he had the Blackened Rockfish. I'd never had breaded salmon before, and while it was good, it left a little to be desired taste-wise. The Rock Fish I was told was tasty, but could've tasted a little Blacker. Had my entree with the best Mai Tai I've ever had!For dessert, I had the Granny Smith Apple Napoleon, which was AMAZING, despite not a hazelnut to be seen. My friend had the Deep Fried Truffle Sundae, which I had a bite of and thought was very good.Finished the meal with some Kenyan coffee to sober us up enough to make it to our next destination :)All and all, it was a very good dining experience. They do get docked a star though do to our complaints (listed above) about the entrees, and the fact that while there was not another person out of the bar/lounge area, they still tried to hide us (a very pierced, tattooed, brightly colored duo) in the furthest table in the back."

The definition of a hole-in-the-wall. I got the regular hamburger and wow... there are no words. A classic burger done right. Crisp bun, juicy patty, stuffed with all the essentials (ketchup, shredded lettuce, tomato, and pickles).

And I wasn't disappointed. We sat at the Bar and was served delicious drinks by Ben. He also recommended some great pairing with our appetizers. He provided excellent service as we feasted on our Happy Hour oysters. They were delicious and too tempting when asked if we wanted more and the minutes seem to pass by faster. The ambiance is really great. You have the view right out to the pier. The food is on point. And I couldn't have been happier with my sweet fresh Seattle oysters. Shout out to Ben and the staff here!

They came with pink Himalayan salt as well as tobasco sauce, and a house made sauce. You can't complain about the cost, and you don't feel guilty eating so many!The service was very friendly, we ordered more as we went and also asked for more sauce and our waiter happily helped us.

They don't give any attitude and will take good care of you. I never thought that I would be able to differentiate between various types of oysters before I started coming here but I was pleasantly surprised. There are a lot of tourists that stop in but it's one of the best attractions in Seattle. It can get a little busy so you need to know when to go, otherwise the service is quick and enjoyable. Its' also clean considering how many people stop in every day. If you are looking for the freshest oysters, go there and you will not be disappointed."

The wait staff was very courteous and attentive, and their recommendations on the menu were very helpful. We had the smoked salmon linguine and Rockfish tacos, along with an oyster sampler. The champagne topping for the oyster sampler went well with the oysters, without overpowering them. The salmon linguine was delicious and a generous portion size, due to being so rich! I actually had trouble finishing it. The Rockfish tacos were delicious and had a very fun presentation - the redness of the very large cut of Rockfish was an eye-catcher. The texture was perfect - most and just flakey enough. The atmosphere and food were top notch, and the setting can't be beat. I would take any newcomer to Seattle here for a real experience of Seattle living!"

I was there today with my girlfriend, and we ordered the same food, but the taste was different. I'm not sure why but it does not taste the same anymore. Very disappointed. Of course, people who never tried this food before will be good to them, but those who have been already eaten this food before will see the difference right away. I hope you guys will bring back the same authentic taste as it was before."
Skalka,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/skalka-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,David Q.,5.0,7/22/2021,5,CA,Waited 50 minutes. Was told to deal with it.It's a pizza (with egg) place. Totally not worth it.
Skalka,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/skalka-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Timofei K.,1.0,9/5/2021,29,WA,"Ridiculous wait list management. We have been said it would take 30 minutes wait, and it haven't been ended in more than an hour."
Skalka,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/skalka-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Bryanna R.,1.0,2/21/2021,7,GA,"I recently visited shalka and found their concept to be quite unique. The food itself was absolutely delicious, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, I do have a few concerns regarding the service that I would like to address, which is why I am deducting a few stars from my overall rating.One issue I encountered was the opening time. Despite the advertised opening time of 9AM, the door was already open for guests to enter before that. It was a bit confusing as we were told that they don't officially open until 9AM, even though we were allowed to hang out inside until then. This inconsistency in their opening procedure was a little frustrating.Additionally, there was a situation where someone placed an order at 8:48AM, and they were told that they needed to wait until 9AM. This kind of miscommunication or refusal of service after the official opening time can be quite off-putting for customers.Lastly, when we wanted to share our meals, we realized that there were no knives available. It would have been more convenient if the restaurant had provided all the necessary utensils to enjoy the meal properly.In order to enhance the overall experience, I would suggest that shalka ensures that their doors are not opened before the official opening time if they are not ready to serve customers yet. Consistency in adhering to the advertised opening hours would greatly improve the customer experience. Additionally, it would be beneficial for them to ensure that all necessary utensils are readily available for customers, especially if sharing meals is encouraged."
Skalka,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/skalka-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Veronica L.,3.0,5/27/2023,67,WA,"This place does bread bowls right! The filling is delicious--cheesy, flavorful, and super satisfying. They offer options for everyone, with chicken, beef, or vegan choices, so there's something for every preference. Each bread bowl is made to order, keeping it nice and crispy on the outside while perfectly holding all that tasty goodness inside. The place itself is clean and set up for self-service, from ordering to cleanup, which makes it an easy, casual stop. Definitely worth a visit if you're craving a hearty, well-made bread bowl!"
Skalka,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/skalka-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Abhijit S.,4.0,11/1/2024,88,WA,"Despite frequently passing by this restaurant, it was my first visit, inspired by rave reviews. I decided to go for brunch on a Saturday, but the timing coincided with the Seafair Torchlight Parade, which led to most streets being closed. After 30 minutes of searching, I found street parking nearly a mile away and walked to the restaurant.**Ambiance**:The restaurant has large floor-to-ceiling windows that let in plenty of natural light, creating an airy and welcoming atmosphere. The decor is funky and fun, adding to the overall charm.**Ordering Process**:I ordered at a kiosk and provided my phone number, which felt unnecessary. It would be more customer-friendly to use numbered tokens instead of collecting personal information. After ordering, the food was brought to my table, and there were no further interactions with the staff during my meal.**Food**:I ordered a Lobiani, which consisted of red beans, runny eggs, bacon, banana peppers, and butter melting into the cheese alongside the egg yolk. Initially, I was unsure how to eat it, but I decided to chip away at the fresh and fluffy bread and use a fork for the filling. Once it was small enough, I used my hands. Although it didn't look very big, it was quite filling, and I had some leftovers.**Taste**:The food was good, but it didn't live up to the rave reviews that had set my expectations very high. It reminded me of a pizza, especially with the egg yolk and two handle-like protrusions on each side. However, it was still enjoyable and satisfying.**Value**:The price was around $18, which seemed reasonable for the portion and quality.**Conclusion**:I have nothing bad to say about the food, but it wasn't as mind-blowing as some reviews claimed. Despite that, I'm a sucker for breakfast restaurants and wouldn't hesitate to return."
Skalka,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/skalka-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Stephanie G.,4.0,7/27/2024,473,CA,"Nestled on the outskirts of Pikes Place in Seattle, Skalka offers a delightful culinary experience with a scenic backdrop that complements its unique approach to dining. The restaurant's commitment to delicious food and an innovative online ordering system makes it a standout in the bustling Seattle food scene.One of the notable features of Skalka is its picturesque location, providing a charming escape from the urban hustle. The ambiance is perfect for those seeking a break from the Pike's Place touristy noise.Skalka takes an unconventional approach to ordering, with the entire process conducted online. While this may be a novel concept, it does streamline the ordering process, ensuring efficiency and accuracy. However, this approach might not suit everyone, especially those who prefer a more traditional experience with face-to-face interaction.The menu at Skalka boasts a variety of delectable options, showcasing a fusion of flavors that cater to diverse palates. The Chicken Boat seemed a bit overwhelming and a bit to ummm mushy. In hindsight, opting for the Cheese Boat alone might have been a wiser choice, as it allowed the individual ingredients to shine without the slight overcrowding observed in the Chicken Boat.While the food at Skalka is undoubtedly a highlight, the service could use a friendlier touch. The online ordering system, while efficient, lacks the personal interaction that many patrons seek in a dining experience. A bit more warmth and engagement from the staff could elevate the overall satisfaction for guests. If the restaurant could enhance its service with a more personable touch, it would undoubtedly secure its place as a must-visit destination on the outskirts of Pikes Place in Seattle."

They make the food to order and it shows. The bread was crisp on the outside and pillowy on the inside. The toppings were fresh and perfectly cooked.

2120,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/2120-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Chenghao L.,1.0,12/17/2018,40,IL,Bad service. Bad server with impolite attitude. Very racist restaurant. Always ignore Asian faces and lie that they don't provide this or that even yelp shows other customers are taking the same service. Don't go. Try somewhere else.
2120,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/2120-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Steven L.,1.0,9/7/2018,7,WA,"I decided to check this place out while I was downtown checking out the biospheres. A weird latin influenced menu which doesn't seem to be figured out yet. The chef seems confused. The cocktails are ok, however there bartender seemed almost irritated that he had to serve me and wasn't very knowledgeable for the food. He was very rude. If your in the hospitality business, shouldn't you not serve with a smile. The location & design are the only reason its getting any star. Underwhelming indeed."

The cool and cozy atmosphere created a special mood for the evening. The service also deserves the highest praise - the staff was attentive and friendly. However, there is one point that slightly clouded my experience. After trying the Prime New York Steak, I ordered it Well Done. Unfortunately, the dish was brought medium rare. But it is worth nothing that when I brought this error to the attention of the waiter, the problem was promptly corrected.Thus, despite a small glitch with the order, the overall impression of the 2120 establishment remained positive."
2120,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/2120-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Marianna K.,3.0,2/12/2024,54,WA,"I visited the restaurant for a mid-week dinner. I had made a reservation a few weeks in advance and arrived slightly late due to traffic. Thankfully, they accommodated us, but requested that we finish by a specific time, which was fine as we had enough time. A nice touch was the free parking available in the same building after 4 pm.The restaurant was quite busy, and it took a while before someone noticed us and took our reservation. However, once we were attended to, the service was smooth. The closely spaced tables contributed to noticeable noise levels, but it wasn't unbearable.We started with some small dishes, which arrived quickly. However, our main courses took a bit longer. We ordered six items, but only one stood out for me, and I would consider ordering it again: the calamari. The green salad was good but rather simple, consisting of greens, strawberries, and crumbled cheese with a tasty vinaigrette. It was enjoyable but not quite at the level I expected.The calamari was very good, with the highlight being the yogurt sauce (though it was labeled as labneh, it wasn't as sour as traditional Mediterranean labneh). The warm spices added a nice touch.The pork belly roulette was disappointing and felt like a calorie waste.I had high hopes for the steak tartar, but it turned out to be overly sour, with the sourness overshadowing the gentle sweetness of the yolk. The textures of the meat and the popping mustard seeds were interesting, but the sourness was too much for my taste.My husband ordered the rack of lamb, which tasted very good but was rather small for its $62 price tag, consisting of only two chops and some veggies.The cream puff had a moderate sweetness level, which was appreciated. However, I found the cream both inside and outside to be overly fatty, with just a hint of fruit filling in the middle. I would have preferred a better balance with less cream and more filling.Despite the restaurant's great reviews, I don't plan on returning."
2120,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/2120-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Libby B.,4.0,6/24/2019,22,WA,I liked this place a lot! I came in for brunch and the food/ drink aesthetic was very pretty and the flavors were very well mixed too! It is also across the street from the Amazon spheres and that was neat. The one downside I really had was that my poached eggs were really over cooked and that's never fun. But I'd definitely be open to coming back!
2120,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/2120-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Christine P.,5.0,6/3/2024,28,WA,"A solid salad, enough to fill you up although I don't think they give as much as evergreens does. Here, I'd stick to a preset menu item over individually ordering because so many things cost extra that it's too much to keep track of. The harvest salad was definitely yummy but I really couldn't tell you how I ended up paying $20 for it. I feel like sweetgreen is cool because it's the prototype for these types of salad places but holy moly I don't want to pay this much for a bowl of kale."
2120,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/2120-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Steve M.,5.0,6/1/2024,353,CA,"I recently dined at 2120, an upscale casual restaurant located inside the Amazon One building, the birthplace of Jeff Bezos' empire. The ambience inside is warm and modern, with about thirty tables and a bar that seats around ten to fifteen people. The restaurant also boasts a very nice patio that overlooks a globe building, adding to its aesthetic appeal.The highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the food and the service. I started with the carrots as an appetizer, which had a surprising texture similar to a baked potato rather than traditional carrots. For the main course, I had the scallops, which were absolutely amazing--tender and delicious, served with a curry and cumin sauce that was out of this world and really highlighted the dish. We also tried the Belgian frites, which were crispy and flavorful, clearly benefitting from their double-frying process.Our server, Will, was excellent. He was attentive without being overbearing, allowing us to enjoy our meal at a comfortable pace. He had great wine recommendations and picked out an incredible dessert for us, carrot cake, which was a perfect end to a wonderful meal. Will truly enhanced our dining experience with his professionalism and expertise.Overall, I highly recommend 2120 for its outstanding food, inviting atmosphere, and exceptional service."

This place had me drooling, and questioning why I hadn't discovered it sooner. Brace yourself for an epic culinary adventure that will leave your belly satisfied!Let's talk about the braised lamb cacciatore, shall we? It was so good that I momentarily forgot my own name. The lamb was so tender, it practically serenaded me with a love ballad as I took my first bite. The tomato sauce was so rich, it had more flavor than a Shakespearean tragedy. I half-expected the chef to burst out of the kitchen and take a bow for this masterpiece. Seriously, they should consider selling tickets to this lamb extravaganza--it's that good!And oh, the pumpkin puff! It was like the dessert gods decided to throw a party in my mouth. The puff pastry was so light and fluffy; I swear it had levitation powers. The pumpkin filling was like a magic potion brewed by a mischievous wizard. One bite, and I was under its spell--complete with giggles, swoons, and a longing for more. Move over Cinderella, this pumpkin creation is the real star of the fairytale!The ambiance was the cherry on top of this feast. The lighting was dim enough to create an intimate atmosphere, but not so dim that I couldn't see my food (because let's be honest, that would be a tragedy).To sum it up, 2120 is the place where culinary excellence. The braised lamb cacciatore and pumpkin puff are the headliners of this comedy show for your taste buds. The staff deserves a standing ovation for their top-notch service. So, bring your appetite, and get ready to feast on delicious food at 2120. It's a culinary adventure you won't soon forget!"

Looking at it from that lens, 2120's salmon would melt apart if you were to simply blow on it like a candle. It was buttery smooth, fatty, with almost no need to chew. It was perfection and I am already planning a return when back in Seattle later this year. Amazing food aside, I also want to shoutout their private dining service. Our group of 20 was welcomed to our dining room with a signature cocktail, a three-course menu imprinted with our names, and friendly service that didn't miss a beat.Highly recommend as a must-visit dinner restaurant."

I had the roasted delicata bowl and my friend had the Caesar salad with shrimp. Both were very good and full of flavor, and the portion sizes were generous. We each had a glass of ros, which was also nice (I like that their wine list is Washington focused). Our food came out in a timely fashion, and our server was very pleasant. The restaurant itself is very pretty with a nice view of the Amazon biospheres. I also like that they have convenient parking in the building. I'll definitely be back for lunch again, and look forward to trying their dinner menu soon."

They have a nice selection of sandwiches, which they had previously, but also added a new Salads & Bowls section that has some yummy sounding dishes. It looks like the bulk of the new dishes have vegetarian options too. I had the roasted delicata dish, and it was very good! Full of flavor, and quite filling. The food came out quickly too, which is great for my lunch time crunch. I look forward to trying some more of the new lunch dishes soon."

I've tried both the dinner and brunch menus, both of which I liked. The lunch menu was also quite good. I like the addition of their ""Bowls & Salads"" section, as it adds a nice, light option. Each of the dishes come with the option to add a protein (salmon, shrimp, or chicken), which is great, and I believe that they all come as vegetarian options by default (with out the added proteins, of course!). I had the quinoa bowl with shrimp, and it was very tasty, and filling, but not heavy. I like that I was able to get in an out for lunch at well under an hour too. I'll be back for sure."

The ambience is so cool.. right on the water and cool lighting. So much more sophisticated than Belltown, but with the mix of crowd (all different ages because it's in a hotel) it never seems pretentious. I've seen various music acts here most of which were fabulous... too good to be free! And the bartenders and wait staff are great (especially Lee at the bar).  The only reason I don't give 5 stars is that the drinks are on the spendy side, and they have to shut the music down at midnight."

They took care of customers and gave great service while keeping the drinks flowing for the dining room. Also, I need to give a shout-out to the guy cleaning up in the lodge area; he also did a great job.The food is top-notch, though-it's a bit on the high side, price-wise. A main course will be about $50-60. Expect to spend in the region of $150-200 dinner for two, including drinks. I had the clam chowder, and it was great. Seafood mix and steak were great, nice and done.The only downside would be that the place feels a little old, but that is not really a big deal."

The restaurant is located in a beautiful waterfront setting, offering stunning views of the Seattle skyline and Elliott Bay. The ambiance is sophisticated and elegant, making it a perfect choice for a special occasion or a romantic evening.The menu at Six Seven Restaurant features a variety of culinary delights. I had the opportunity to try their seafood dishes, and they were delicious. The flavors were well-balanced, and the presentation was impeccable. The freshness of the ingredients was evident in every bite, and the seafood was cooked to perfection.The service at Six Seven Restaurant was exceptional. The staff was attentive, and knowledgeable, and provided excellent recommendations. They were also mindful of dietary restrictions and accommodated special requests with ease.In addition to the wonderful food and service, the restaurant offers an extensive wine list and a well-crafted cocktail menu. The sommelier was helpful in suggesting pairings that enhanced the dining experience.The only minor drawback was that the prices at Six Seven Restaurant are on the higher side, reflecting the upscale dining experience and waterfront location. However, considering the quality of the food, service, and ambiance, it was a worthwhile investment.Overall, I would highly recommend Six Seven Restaurant to those looking for an elegant dining experience in Seattle. The combination of exquisite cuisine, impeccable service, and breathtaking views make it a standout restaurant that truly showcases the best of the city."

Having had dinner multiple times here before in their main dinning area, the food was more than impressive. The view is picturesque and the food is exceptional- for all intents and purposes, this was a great place for a wedding reception. While the overall picture was great, the Catering Team GAVE THEIR WEDDING CAKE AWAY.The cake was bought through Palisade made through a local vendor, Dessert Works, with whom they had a cake tasting months prior like most couples do. The assistant manager came up to the BRIDE during the pictures and said that 'WE' have a problem. They had lost the cake.The bride and groom were nothing but pleasant and accommodating (what else were they supposed to do?) and had their ceremony. During the reception, the assistant manager again spoke to the bride and said that after investigating the matter, they had concluded the cake was GIVEN TO THE ANOTHER WEDDING RECEPTION THE NIGHT BEFORE. He proceeded to describe that 'WE' had two options: a cake from QFC (he misspoke and meant Whole Foods- imagine the astonishment) or cupcakes from Cupcake Royale. The Bride and Groom chose cupcakes and did not elude to their company of the unfortunate mistake as most of the guests thought this was their choice for dessert. Although many people choose cupcakes for their reception, this was not the cake they chose. After more investigating, Dessert Works did their job and delivered what could only be imagined to be a wonderful cake that another wedding party got to enjoy (were they VIP?) because the bride and groom's name was on the cake box according to Dessert Works.Palisade compensated in various ways but you can not replicate the moment or pictures of your wedding day again."

THIS IS THE ONLY RESTARAUNT I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN KICKED OUT OF! Why? Simply because I asked an obviously overworked doorman why my car hadn't been brought out for us when many others behind us in line were being brought their car?! He accused me of ""touching him"" on the shoulder. I was with a company christmas party in 2008, and EVERYONE WAS APPAULED. Needless to say I will never return. ALSO! Take notice that the people most excited about the restaraunt ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE. They often seem overwhelmed with satisfaction of their own restaraunt, snobbish. If you go, see if you agree....Oh! AND DEFINATELY DON'T USE THE VALET!!! Much better optioin is SALTY'S restaraunt in West Seattle, especially for Sunday brunch. Unlike the Palisades, it's an open buffet of EVERYTHING...meat, seafood, omelette bar, NOT JUST PANCAKES!"

The food quality was very disappointing. I had the surf and turf and ordered my steak medium rare. It came after a long 45+ minute wait, only to cut into it and it was well done. I never send food back, but I did on this occasion because it was a 3:15pm dinner reservation and there is no excuse to overcook steaks when it's not super busy. After sending it back, I was brought a steak that they just threw on the grill for a couple minutes on high heat and they called it a day. It was absolutely rare in the middle and burnt outside. Worst cooked steak ever. I ate it cause it was $74 but the whole deal was terrible. They were out of the desert we wanted at 4:30pm. They said it was cause of the banquet that they had. Ok lol. This place just sucked these days. If you're gonna spend money like that. Go somewhere else for sure. The view is nice of course. But you could find a way better restaurant."

Hostess staff great and the meal went downhill from there. Appetizer felt like QFC sushi cheap. Steak was overdone we sent back and my wifes sat there for 15 minutes - they brought another 22 minutes later after she had finished very poor serving should have taken hers to stay warm. Then forgot shared salad. When I went to the bathroom I asked to talk to the manager and they point out a bald guy named Paul who said oh he was really sorry. He then offered to buy us a drink, which we were charged for. So as we were leaving we asked to see him again to tell him. I saw him in the hallway behind the bathroom and they said nope he is not here. He was laughing with his girlfriend or hitting on a cocktail waitress. Only reason it gets 2 is the view and the hostess. Awful service and good food but very overpriced."

The food was ok, but the service definitely needs improvement. After remarking to our waiter that we had a hair on the caesar salad, the manager then came over and gave a half-hearted apology and quite frankly just ruined the evening for me and the misses. I don't mean to be one of those vindictive type of yelp reviewers, but certainly this place could use a bit of improvement. On the plus side, the Palisades Ocean Tower was delicious and the cabarnet short rib was delicious."

Meanwhile, we watched other customers, who arrived after us, being served promptly. The servers took their orders, brought out appetizers, and attended to them, but no one bothered to check on us.What made it even more frustrating was that the staff clearly saw us waiting--they even glanced in our direction several times--but chose to ignore us completely. It felt disrespectful and left us wondering why we were being treated this way.After waiting and hoping for someone to acknowledge us, we finally gave up and left. It was humiliating and upsetting to experience such poor service, especially when we had been excited to try a new restaurant.This was the first time something like this had ever happened to us at a restaurant, and it will certainly be the last time we visit Tanoor. If this is how they treat customers, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."

We decided to go on a Friday to avoid the dinner rush. It wasn't very busy, but we ended up waiting for service for 30 minutes. Nobody offered us water and we noticed other people being served. Eventually, we just decided to leave and went to a place across the street. Nobody said anything to us as we left; they seemed more interested in their own conversations. We won't be recommending this place to anyone. Maybe the food is good, but the service, or lack thereof, was really bad. Even Stone Korean, which is much smaller, has better service than this place."

House made pita... wow! With a large variety of dips- we had the muhammara - peppers,walnuts, pomegranate syrup with a touch of spiciness- could have made a meal from that and the pita! The mixed plate for 2-3 easily served 5 people- freshly grilled veggies, 3 quality meats cooked just right, yellow ( saffron?) rice.  Great value for the quantity of food!    No alcoholic drinks, but a wide variety of juices, teas, and Turkish coffee. Will definitely become a repeat customer!Dietary restrictions: Good variety of keto and vegetarian options.Wheelchair accessibility: I have limited mobility, so I appreciated the no barrier entry- they let me come in a different door,closer to where I parked. Parking nearby would be difficult, as one side of the building is on a steep hill."

The food was good and fresh except Kunnafah, they really need to fix that. It was soggy and chewy, rest everything was amazing. I will visit again but will never order dessert."

Surprisingly, this place always brews my coffee fresh. Which a lot of places don't do. And I get a desert to pair with it nicely. I'd just like to say thank you for always providing great and consistent service. I would recommend this place to anyone."

The food was perfect in flavor and portion. Their home made pita bread was next level and our server was knowledgeable of the cuisine and friendly.
