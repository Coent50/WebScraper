Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Joel S.,1.0,4/27/2022,Went here for lunch and one of the staff was being rude to my friend. Would never come back again. There are so many ways to deal with customers but that was definitely not the one.
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Hasan A.,1.0,4/27/2022,Worst service ever. This place is good only for their food but not their service. Come here if you want to order to go only.

Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Nina L.,1.0,6/6/2019,Me and my friends we're very disappointed at their menu because we thought they have a lot of menu that we can choose but they didn't. We expected that they have soup either for lunch.
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Zehra B.,1.0,3/31/2018,"We were a party of three including my one year old son, and we were asked to move tables to accommodate a party of 10 during our meal as we were in between eating our food. We had pushed the food out of our sons reach and were probably taking up one extra seating. Plain simple rude to ask a customer to change seats while in the middle of a meal, completely ruined my appetite and my $70 down the drain!! Addressed issue with manager only to be told that a lie, that the party had a reservation. Never going back again!"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,S M.,2.0,12/6/2019,"The food was tasty, but not worth the high prices. Service was friendly but not very attentive."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Nhi H.,3.0,7/30/2021,"I was really excited to come here after hearing from the a coworker about their food. I came here one night and knew I had to get the spicy jumbo wings, they good, but just drenched in fish sauce and it was just so heavily breaded that it wasn't much meat underneath. Now don't get me wrong, I can handle my fish suave being that I'm Vietnamese, but this was just too much for me. We also got the shrimp paste grilled on lemongrass stalks and that too was just way too over powering and made it almost too bitter to eat. Over all the decorations were fun and interesting to look at. The cocktails were mediocre. And the wait is always so long, there are better Thai restaurants in the area with no wait and food you can actually enjoy."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Edwiny D.,3.0,5/4/2021,Ok the taste was pretty good but the food seemed to be not that fresh. Considering the allure of the restaurant I believe these things matter a lot. The food seems to be a bit uncooked and that made me notice the staleness of the food upon observation. I'll give it a 3/5.
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Ajay C.,3.0,6/30/2018,"Okay, don't take this review into account if you not a vegetarian.I really admire the ambience, vibes around this place. Totally loved it.But why 3 starts?Ordered -Cambodian Salor Kari Sap Curry : isn't exciting as it sounds. This is a Thai food. I could get this at a thai place for much cheaper price. Tastes great though.Price on this item was $20. Yes, you get less than half the portion you expect. Totally overpriced. Im still surprised about the ratings they have on yelp.If you still wanna try, go for it."
