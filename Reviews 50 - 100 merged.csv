A+ Hong Kong Kitchen;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/a-hong-kong-kitchen-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Kady C.;2;5/21/2017;16;OR;We came here with high expectations, but were disappointed. We got the curry fish balls, xo sauce rice noodle, cold lemon tea, ice coffee tea, and four other desserts. The curry fish ball doesn't taste like expected, taste noting like something you would find in Hong Kong, the XO sauce noodle was really good actually, would definitely order again. The drink was blend and bitter, no sweetness at all. All the desserts were lacking in flavor. Felt like something you get out of the package, especially the sesame and tofu mix. Service was also another disappointment.

The entire meal was not extraordinary. Except for the rice porridge, the price is around which is fair for the large amount of food. The workers look tired but attentive.

A+ Hong Kong Kitchen;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/a-hong-kong-kitchen-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Dennis H.;4;7/28/2022;13;WA;Delicious Hong Kong style eatery. They have noodle soup and dumplings. The food was very tasty, and different as many of the flavors are not typical in Western foods. I would come back for sure. Only downside here is that it is so popular there is always a line out the door. Staff is friendly and efficient as well.

But it is worth the wait. Been here twice and cant wait for my next visit. The flavors are unique but delicious. I'm not an expert on food from Hong Kong, but what I do know is that this place is fantastically Dee Lish!!!

A+ Hong Kong Kitchen;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/a-hong-kong-kitchen-seattle?not_recommended_start=10;Christina G.;5;6/26/2024;83;TX;"A+ Hong Kong Kitchen delivers a satisfying dining experience with a variety of flavorful dishes. The Stir Fried Rice Roll With XO Sauce stood out with its great savory taste from the XO sauce, perfectly cooked exterior with a slight crust, and a soft inside--definitely a dish worth repeating. The Baked Portuguese Chicken Rice featured a nice cheesy crust on top, tasting like Thai curry with some vegetables mixed in. The Salted Pork & Chinese Sausage Rice Stone Pot, complemented by a side of Chinese greens, was a solid choice. Pro-tip: let the rice sit for a bit to get a nice crust on the bottom. The pork was tender and flavorful, while the sausage was standard but paired well with the crispy rice. The side of greens was good, nothing special.For dessert, the Mango Sago Pomelo with Purple Rice was tasty but I wish it had more purple rice and sago, though the mango sago itself was nice. The Grass Jelly with Mango was good despite the mango not being fully ripe and the grass jelly coming from a can; the condensed milk paired nicely with the ingredients, though more of it would have been better. The Mango Smoothie with Coconut Milk and Sago was sweet and tasty, with a strong mango flavor that paired well with the coconut milk and sago. I would come back just for this drink.Service was quick and attentive, with hot tea served at no charge and water available upon request. It's small inside and there's not a lot of seating but it's cozy that way. Overall, A+ Hong Kong Kitchen offers a delightful array of dishes that make it worth a visit."

One of their staff told me that this is their first week opening, so their business is very slow. I was there for an hour and no one walks in. I was first scared because I wonder if it's because their food is not good, but I'm glad I didn't walked out! I had there seafood congee, it came out the same as the photos they have. Can tell that the ingredients were in high quality. I got offered a milk tea sample before my meal and a dessert sample after my meal! Wow, am I in Costco? I highly recommend this place if you want to stay away from those Americanized Chinese food. Can't find sweet and sour here, but a lot of other options that are new to try. Will definitely come back for their dessert.

It is new openings, but this place is really as good as people say it is. For people that know my food preferences, they will tell you that Chinese food is my least favorite cuisine, but I stumble upon some gems every now and then. I came here one afternoon with friends after having a meeting downtown. They seat us right away and explain the menu to us. We ordered some baked rice, noodle soup, chicken wings, drinks and dessert. I love everything we ordered.

So we waited an hour for a table and then two groups of 4 showed up and the girl at the front wanted to seat us at the bar instead. I told her we waited an hour for the table and the groups just showed up. But her excuse was the table was for bigger groups. They why make us wait an hour. She was so rude about it and just wanted a bigger tip. I'll never come here, the staff is incompetent, rude and money hungry. The food didn't look good anyways. Go to the hummus place next door, they are better and cheaper. Don't believe everything you see on TikTok.

It was pretty tender and flavorful. The breading was perfectly crispy, and the oroshi sauce added a nice kick of flavor. However, I have to say that I preferred the Kurobuto Katsu, which had an even juicier meat quality that was simply delicious. The portion sizes were generous, and the service was attentive without being intrusive. Overall, I give it 3/5! If you're looking for a tonkastu restaurant this will do it justice

The outer layer of bread crumbs is fried golden and crispy, and when you bite it, you can feel the perfect contrast of crispy outside and tender inside. The cheese melts under high temperature, and the rich milky aroma that flows out blends with the tender pork cutlet, which is endless aftertaste.

TL;DR place is not worth lol. but read more to find out why. - the food was honestly mediocre at best. the tastiest thing I had tonight was the corn cheese but that's honestly really hard to get wrong so... but we got the small beef feast combo and it just did not live up to expectations. the meat quality was okay don't get me wrong, but the flavor was MISSING. not to mention the array or lack thereof, of sauces was NOT that girl. I think like for the $120 price for two, definitely worth taking it somewhere else because of the lack of taste alone. the beef tartare was actually the best thing 2nd to the corn cheese that night. But honestly, Meet's meat was not giving and im sad bc I was looking forward to eating here.- the restaurant does give a nice vibe for a date night. So that's a +- our server was great! I think she did her best at being attentive while juggling the bar. I will say that I wish we got some of our side dishes out sooner and they did forget our corn cheese sometimes so we had to bug about it but I felt bad since she was already doing her best. all the love to her she was getting worked.overall: not goodnot rlly giving the way i wish meet was going to but oh well. don't make the same mistake we did"

Meet Korean BBQ;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/meet-korean-bbq-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Luke L.;4;05-06-2024;192;WA;Come to Meet for a truly elevated Korean BBQ experience. But not in a good way. But also not in a bad way.Let me explain. The quality of the meats is exceptional - each cut was incredibly flavorful and tender. The presentation was also top-notch, with beautiful marbling and careful attention to detail.However, while the quality was undeniable, the quantity left me wanting more. The portions were smaller than I expected, and I did not find myself satiated after ordering even several dishes. Good for my waistline, not so good for my wallet. For the price, I would have liked more generous servings.As someone who prefers an all-you-can-eat (AYCE) style, I personally missed the abundance of meat that usually comes with it. While I might sacrifice a bit of quality for a more fulfilling meal, I can't deny that the few bites I had at Meet Korean BBQ were delicious.If you're seeking a high-end Korean BBQ experience with exquisite meats and impeccable service, Meet Korean BBQ is a great choice. However, if you're looking for a more budget-friendly option or prefer larger portions, this might not be the ideal spot for you.

The whole process from making a reservation to the meal its self is so out dated. The decorations were out dated and the food was mediocre at best. I used to go here as a kid with my family. i don't think we had the money to pay $80 a person. I don't think the quality has gone up. But the prices sure have. Initially I was so excited to have so many options. But I wasn't impressed with the options that were given and ended up with just a small plateful of food. I didn't get my moneys worth.Not sure where all the money is going but its not to upgrade the building. They have the best view of Seattle but the building seems like its falling apart.Another thing, it would be nice to know I wouldn't be eating in the main dining room prior to booking my reservation. The down stairs feels like a banquet room and not a restaurant and it did not impress anyone around me. I over heard my ""neighbors"" with the same complaint.Perhaps under new ownership and with an updated feel I would come again for the VIEW!!!"

I would give it a negative rating if I could. I had the WORST experience at the Salty's in Seattle on Alki Beach. I went there for a friends birthday party. We got drinks at the bar and they didn't have premium liquor, so we went for lesser liquor and made it a double...well that was a mistake because apparently bartenders there think that means you get charged 3 drinks instead of the double price. My cosmo got spilled at the table more than half full and she asked if I wanted another, I said no, I was switching to beer, usually restaurants will take the drink off your bill or discount it if more than half was spilled, but this one doesn't. Long story short, we went to the bar, paid our tab, and left. Our friends texted us later asking if we paid our bill, because they were accusing us of dining and dashing. I had to call the manager and tell him we had our card back, because we paid it and they gave it back to us. The manager looked it up and saw that we DID pay, but it wasn't enough. There was added drinks on our tab and I had to argue with the manager about what we ordered. He basically called me a liar and we were charged us more than we had. We ended up paying more than double what we should have. AND the manager was a total jerk about it. I have NEVER been treated so badly at a restaurant in my life. The manager was one of the rudest people I have EVER dealt with in the restaurant business. I will NEVER go back to this establishment or recommend it to ANYONE, unless you want to be treated like crap by the staff and management and pay too much for crappy drinks....

We have 12 in our party and were told to make two reservations of six. When the reservations person returned our call to confirm the reservation weeks later, we were told me could only make one reservation at one time and that we were only confirmed for 6. Also that we could only be at our table for one and a half hours. We then chose another place to make reservations.That being said, Salty's has been a great place to dine and we have only had great experiences there. Thank you for reading.

In June, there was a surf and turf special with top sirloin and halibut for $24.99 so we thought we'd give it another try. Since the special didn't come with a salad, we decided to order one on the side. We should have got a clue when the waiter said the $9.50 salad wasn't enough to split. We ordered 2 salads that were so tiny they were a joke. The salad was ONE leaf of romaine with some chopped tomatoes, etc on top. Geez - how expensive is lettuce? We were never offered any bread, so we guessed it wasn't included. Some of the surrounding tables had a basket of crackers, we never got those either. I guess you didn't get any unless you asked. The halibut was nicely prepared - all 3 ounces. The steak was a generous portion and very good, but since we mostly came for the seafood, it was disappointing. In retrospect, we should have complained at the time, we just think we won't go back.The view is great.

Great, great atmosphere and view of Seattle skyline. The last three visits my steak was rubbery and ploorly cooked.  This Christmas Eve buffet cost 110 per person. The food was an average Sunday afternoon brunch. Nothing special for the holidays. Prime rib was chewy and tasteless. The drinks were good but pricey. The service was slow and easily forgettable. When we arrived we were put in an outdoor tent with polyurethane floors under the decking. Everything smelled of tarps. My date was NOT impressed. We moved to another table by grand central beverage department. In a positive note, we loved The decorations and vibe.

Lucky, I was able to try the Baked Alaska (correct me if I'm wrong). So it was unique, the presentation was just amazing. Well, seafood were just so fresh. Lastly, my least expected from this restaurant, is that they have many interesting artworks inside.

I've been here a few times but it seems to have gone down hill recently. Also, they force you to valet park now? They still have that amazing view though and we did get seating in a really good position. I'd also consider updating the chairs, they are extremely uncomfortable.

The whole experience starts with the fantastic views across the Sound and the Seattle skyline. Our hostess seated us quickly and provided us with a great table. Our server was very attentive. We started with clam chowder. It's among the best. Then, we shared an Alaskan King Crab leg. Not as fresh as we're used to. At $85, a little disappointing. Our main course was the scallops plate with rice cakes. This was a real treat. We had a little room for dessert and went with the berries shortcake. It promised to be drenched in berry saurce. It was more desert than dessert. The angel food cake was more dense than the norm and there was a serious shortage of sauce. We're glad Salty's is open for indoor dining. In the end, our experience was good, but not great.

While the weather wasn't particularly cooperative, with a less than spectacular view of the sky line, the service was on the whole, above average. Our dedicated server was friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. It's hard to go wrong when you take friends to breakfast here, as there truly is something for everybody. I want to love ""the best eggs benedict"" in Seattle, they claim to serve, but I always seem to hit the chafing dish at the wrong time. Not to worry, there are soooo many other options. The build your own omelette is fantastic and the young man working the station was just a DOLL. The mini waffles are amazing and there's no shortage of topping options. These are the best I've had, anywhere. My personal favorite is the ginourmous barrel of Dungeness Crab. They have drawn butter o n hand, but WHY? There truly is no need, as the crab is always fresh (you can see the tanks of the little buddies waving at you in the window as you walk in) and delicious.Multiple trips are necessary, as there's the chocolate fountain to consider...YUM and the desert table. I found some of the deserts hit or miss; the cream puffs and bread pudding were meh, though the caramel sauce (on the pudding) was fantastic (i'll take a cup of that to go, please) and my black bottom cupcake was dry and tasteless. The mini passion fruit tarts were fantastic, and I'm kicking myself in retrospect for not having a few more.All in all, Salty's is a Seattle tradition and a wonderful place to take out of town visitors. There is no way to walk away hungry and when the weather cooperates the view is breathtaking!"

Salty's Waterfront Seafood Grills;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/saltys-waterfront-seafood-grills-seattle?not_recommended_start=60;E A.;4;7/25/2008;4;WA;"I've read a lot of the reviews here and think they are pretty balanced but there is a certain trend to them that bothers me. As someone who has worked in a lot of restaurants it amazes me that people get so upset when they aren't sat exactly at their reservation time. A reservation guarantees that you have priority for that time over someone who just walks in the door. It also enables a resaturant to at least try to staff accordingly. But there are a lot of variables involved. What is the restaurant supposed to do with the diners who linger for 2 1/2 hours? What if they have sick staff. Maybe the kitchen is struggling that night and needs an extra five minutes to catch up before the next wave of guests orders. Have a little more consideration for a hostess who is trying to accomodate the needs of staff and guest alike. Not everyone can sit at a window at the same time. Also, I noticed that people talk about slow service. HAve you looked at how physically huge Salty's is? Did you pay attention to how long the walk PAST THE KITCHEN to your table was. Your server makes that walk at a dash every time you demand your FREE bread, your extra condiments and your ""lemon for you water."" If you are DOWNSTAIRS on the patio, how long do you think it would take you to run up the stairs each time you need a fresh drink or another basket of carb loaded bread? Use some common sense when making reviews based on things like slow seating or service."

I had to take my time to write this review because the experience I had here was truly exceptional. The view from the restaurant is phenomenal; you can see the whole city of Seattle over the ocean. It's so beautiful. The host was helpful, although she could be a bit more welcoming, remembering that she is the face of the house (I must mention that I was mistaken about my reservation, and she kindly helped me). However, the rest of my experience was amazing.Our server, Chrissy, was unlike any I've ever encountered. She was incredibly professional, knowledgeable about the menu, and detailed in explaining how each dish was prepared. It was an unbelievable experience, and if you visit, make sure to ask for her. She will give you a dining experience like no other. The highlight of my visit was definitely her service.The food was outstanding. We tried the clam chowder, which was excellent, and the mimosas, which came in different flavors and were delightful. The salmon was incredibly flavorful, and the appetizers were amazing. Every aspect of my dining experience at this restaurant was fantastic, and I will definitely be returning.A special thanks to Chrissy for her phenomenal service and for creating such a wonderful experience for us. She truly elevated the art of serving to a whole new level. I would also like to mention the manager who came to our table; it was a nice touch. Overall, I would give this place 10 stars because five stars are simply not enough for this exceptional restaurant."

The service has always been excellent - friendly servers, always feel welcome, and the food has never been late. I've enjoyed most everything I've ever ordered.

First this is some of the best staff I've ever encountered. The servers are beyond helpful, super friendly, and very attentive (never had to ask for a refill they are close by paying attention). The atmosphere is nice, welcoming, and spacious. It has an under water theme and love how they put down brown paper for a fast clean up of the mess that you will make. The food is so good!!! The crabs taste fresh and the spicy oceanic sauce is a nice taste of fresh flavors.They had a daily special that consisted of lobster, pineapple, and Mac n cheese which was one of the best meals I've ever had and literally cannot stop thinking about. The flavors complimented each other nicely. I do hope they will have this special for awhile or even make it permanent because everyone should be as blessed to try this. If you are looking for a seafood boil I highly recommend this place.

It is a Seattle institution. It is loved. I have been to no less than 3 big events and many dinners at Salty's... so I know my way around the menu and the place. The event room underneath is probably the most romantic and beautiful places in all of Seattle to have a wedding reception. It is large, open and has (just like the restaurant above) a fantastic view. If you are in the restaurant the best place for a seat are the corner windows... there are only 2 of them and the one on the northern side is best.There really is a great view from pretty much everywhere in the joint, but the corners are the best.The oysters are always a favorite as well as the salmon. I am not really a fan of the beef here.. or anywhere... but my blood thirsty friends seem to appreciate it.Local brews and wines can be found. The service is awesome. If it is your birthday you might get a free white cake slice. MIGHT. I think 3 out of the 5 or 6 times I went for birthdays, the waiter offered the cake. It must depend on who is working that day. The cake is amazing.

Kokkaku;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kokkaku-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Tara B.;3;08-03-2019;12;WA;Place is sooo overpriced.There was no other patron there except us checking it out for dinner at 5:30pm on a weekday, and later on there was a couple who arrived at 7pm or so. There were 3 people behind the bar and around the service area of the restaurant so there was definitely plenty of service.Food was good, but the menu shows expensive beef (like Butcher's Table and Ruth Chris' prices) but the restaurant feels more casual. Perhaps they can knock off the price a little to reflect the location and casual feel so there will be more people coming.
Kokkaku;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kokkaku-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Nancy M.;4;6/21/2022;7;WA;Taste for some dishes are pretty surprising and special compared to other Japanese restaurant, price is reasonable and service is good. Only complain is the serve speed is a tad slow.
Kokkaku;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kokkaku-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Robert B.;4;1/30/2021;24;WA;If you like quality steak, I would check this place out. They make a delicious medium-rare.

Kokkaku;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kokkaku-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Paul G.;5;11-05-2024;3;WA;I recently had the pleasure of dining at Kokkaku in Seattle's U-District, and it was an unforgettable experience. This place is a paradise for meat lovers, with an amazing Japanese twist on classic favorites like steak and burgers. I ordered a burger, and it was easily one of the best I've ever had. The flavors were incredibly balanced, and the meat was cooked to absolute perfection. The ambiance is cozy yet modern, making it a great spot for anything from a casual meal to a special night out. The staff were warm, welcoming, and attentive, adding to the overall positive experience.For anyone in the U-District looking for a unique and delicious dining experience focused on high-quality meats, I highly recommend it

The quality of the meat was exceptional, and the preparation was flawless. Each bite was a symphony of flavors, perfectly seared on the outside and tender on the inside. I've never encountered anything quite like this in my culinary adventures.What sets Kokkaku apart is its ability to outshine even the most upscale steakhouses. The authenticity of the Japanese culinary techniques, combined with the impeccable service, creates an experience that transcends the ordinary. This is not just a meal; it's a journey into the world of exquisite flavors and culinary artistry.In conclusion, Kokkaku Japanese Steakhouse is a gem that deserves every bit of praise.

Definitely go for the brunch - it's the best value and their brunch buffet table has delicious food (although it's a lot of food to eat since you still get the same meat experience as dinner). I've come here for dinner as well, and I highly recommend the dessert! The key lime pie especially was so good!

It is wide and spacious: perfect for social distancing! The quality and portion of the steak were great, and it was also nice that there were options for a side of onion rings or french fries.

The pricing is fair.Let's start with the drinks, as I believe they pay the most attention to their cocktails. Very pretty presentation and enjoyable taste, very smooth.For food, most of it can be shared, because the portions are generous and the plates are huge. My friend and I went by yelp recommendations and chose the chicken waffle, which was not bad.We also tried the french fries and 3 burger set which I don't remember the name, sorry.Definitely deserves a chance, the cocktails will have you coming back.

Although there are no reservations, we were lucky enough to get a table for 4 right near the front of the restaurant. It was a little chilly that night whenever the door opened, so you may want to bring a layer that you'll want to wear while you eat. Food was great and were of relatively large proportions for a Seattle trendy/hipster restaurant. Most of us ordered the pork sliders, which were oddly good even though they didn't have the traditional BBQ sauce on the side. And those french fries - I could have shoved them all in my face at once, but managed to contain myself. Everyone liked the cocktails they ordered. I had the Orlando, which was delicious. All in all, a good night. We'll try to return here for their brunch, and just in general, because I think you get a lot of bang for your buck here. The only downside was that they could turn down their music just a touch.
Witness;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/witness-seattle?not_recommended_start=10;Lindsay M.;4;5/31/2017;7;CA;Had breakfast with some friends one morning.

The one dish I like the most is the chicken and waffles, the chicken strips are great but the waffle is really the star of the dish. I have been to Roscoes in California and I like their chicken better but this is pretty good. The decor is cool as well

Can not ask for much more than that. Greg the owner greeted us at the pub and we talked with him about the way in which the restaurant was going and he looked like a fine and funny man. We ate the Chicken and Waffles, the Shrimp and Grits, and Beignets and all were superb. They make a great sazerac, my favourite beverage that I order at many pubs but few are great. My wife had a Black as Pitch which was rum, stout along with a whole uncooked egg and it was quite yummy too. Yet another great place on the hill added to our repertoire.

Everything that comes out of the kitchen looks warm, delicious, and freshly prepared. A lady sat next to us at the bar one night eating the pork belly special, and it smelled so good I wanted to take it off her plate.But back to the drinks- they're so fun here! I think I like everything on the menu, especially those drinks containing whiskey :). The bartenders are really knowledgeable about their alcohol selection and will recommend different whiskeys to try neat if you let them know what type of flavors/ bodies of whiskey you prefer. I love when bartenders take time to cater to your tastes, and this place definitely does that! I also love their cocktail with an egg white in it. I know it sounds gross! But the egg white gave the cocktail a creamy, smooth texture without adding any weird taste to it. I asked her to put an egg white in my second cocktail (which she completely made up) and it was just as good! Weird finding- guess I like egg whites in my whiskey cocktails. Gotta thank Witness for opening up that door for me though!

The secret, I'm told by someone in the know, is the buttermilk brine. Huge portions means you get to enjoy it again tomorrow. Or come REALLY hungry. Great cocktails and an enormous selection of booze. I think they could make you damn near anything you wanted with exactly the booze you want in it. Highly recommend.

Their Shrimp Po' Boy is likely my favorite dish, closely followed by their chicken and waffles with bourbon maple syrup!On this most recent trip we got the chicken and waffles, but also changed it up with their new ratatouille.This was different than I was expecting, it was much more of a salad with greens than what I think of as ratatouille. The crunchy okra (I believe) was a great addition though. Not bad, but much more salad-y than I was expecting.As whenever I get it, the chicken was nice and crunchy with light fluffy waffles!
Witness;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/witness-seattle?not_recommended_start=40;Sarah S.;5;10/27/2018;12;WA;"Both mine and my friend were utterly stuffed after our meal here. I had the grit meal, and you might be thinking ""grits, as a meal, that's it?"" I can assure you, it is gourmet grits, with bacon bits (way better than dollar store variety) and a sunny-side up egg smack dab in the middle of the dish. My friend had the chicken and waffles and she claimed that she was full for the next 9 hours.The atmosphere is full of reclaimed wood and church pews are used as the booths. There's surprisingly plenty of room for groups at the pew tables and multiple groups throughout the restaurant. The food comes relatively quick. One thing: the food is clean, not overtly grease and doesn't *feel* unhealthy. But there is a lack of veggies and stuff, and that's to be expected. It's ""clean southern"", if that makes sense?"

Witness;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/witness-seattle?not_recommended_start=50;John K.;5;12-02-2014;5;WA;I started with a cocktail, I got the Son of a Preacher Man which was bourbon with black tea, lemon, and honey liqueur. I'm typically not a big cocktail guy but I thought it was really good, struck a nice balance between the bourbon and the sweetness. For food I ordered the Chicken and Waffles, and I will say the fried chicken was definitely worth the hype. They're chicken tender style so they're boneless, the meat was moist, and the skin was perfectly seasoned and flaky, and wasn't excessively oily/greasy like typical fried chicken. The waffles were good, but really waffles are just waffles, hard to mess up waffles. Waffles.Atmosphere was good and has a nice vibe to it, classy and clean but still manages to be pretty casual. Price point is a tad bit high, and for that if I could give it 4.5 stars I would, but overall it was pretty damn good so I'll round up.

The White Swan Public House;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-white-swan-public-house-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0;Matthew H.;1;7/20/2024;5;TX;"I recently went here after many times walking around SLU and thinking this place would be a nice ambiance to eat at. Unfortunately the ambiance is the only thing worth enjoying here. It took probably 15-20 minutes to receive our order of ""crab"" hush puppies which probably had less crab than crab rangoons at a takeout place. The huhshpuppies tasted like fried oil and the honey butter did not pair well. The drink my wife ordered, the San Junipero, was quite tasty and smooth! It took another 20 minutes after we finished our appetizer to order our main entrees and I was intrigued by the Elk entree. The unfortunate result was that the Elk had almost no flavor and was sitting on a bed of gnocchi that tasted like a Mediterranean pasta and had no business being plated with an Elk steak covered in capers. My wife ordered the fish-witch and I don't think I've seen her more disinterested in a sandwich before. It was incredibly salty like it had been cruising on the sound for hours, and had the texture of jerky. What's unfortunate is the dish was supposed to come with an aioli but they gave her ketchup which did not provide much comfort to the ass'salted' sandwich. I would say to only come here if you're looking for a good ambiance and tasty drinks, otherwise the meal is not worth the price."

We had a vegetarian with a group of us and they couldn't eat at all. The service was slow and often we felt forgotten by the server. Drinks were over priced and the vibe just isn't that friendly from the staff or management. Sadly this spot has had some great bars that were alot of fun and always packed, this place does not have that going on for it. We live close but we won't be going back.

Stateside;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/stateside-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=0;Hanna B.;2;05-09-2019;6;NC;"This was one of the most disappointing meals I have ever had. I ate here in July 2018 while visiting Seattle, and saw that this was rated Seattle's best restaurant in 2015, but it completely underwhelmed my expectations.The food was incredibly average, unseasoned, and the presentation of some of the dishes was confusing or annoying. Drinks: the cocktails were actually very good, so if you want to go for a cocktail and a small plate or two it may not be a bad idea. I had the pineapple margarita. There is rum in it, and I am not a huge rum fan, but the smokey tastes of grilled pineapple and mezcal really complimented the light sweetness of the drink.Food, We had: -The crispy duck fresh rolls, which were just mediocre Peking duck. I don't know why they tried make it seem like they were reinventing the wheel here.- A pork dish small plate where the waiter presented the dish with a 60-second explanation of how to eat it. The dish was written on the menu as a small pork bites with dipping sauces. In reality, the dish was designed as pork on taco-like shells made of vermicelli noodles, and the sauces were meant to be drizzled on top of these ""tacos"". 1) Vermicelli noodles should NEVER be used as taco shells. 2) If your dish needs 60 seconds of explanation, you should not be serving it. The pork and the wraps were way too chewy to be able to be eaten as it was designed, as you could not easy just take a bite at a time. -Goat curry - this was the only dish that tasted seasoned. But I would be impressed if someone was serving an unseasoned curry...-A noodle dish - the noodles here seemed to be angel hair pasta rather than an Asian rice noodle. Which made the dish difficult to eat and share, as pasta is much more chewy than a rice noodle. Overall, I was left annoyed and dissatisfied, but it certainly not the worst meal I have ever had. Just one where I was left annoyed by my meal. I would have given 1 star if I hadn't enjoyed the drink."
Stateside;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/stateside-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=0;Jay K.;2;2/28/2016;123;WA;I was expecting more from Stateside. I think it's overrated and too expensive for the tastes and portions it offers. I found the rice paper of the crispy duck rolls too dry and the sauce that went with it too salty. The black cod entrée cost $28 and only had three tiny pieces of cod, it's a rip-off. The goat curry was my favorite. Their beer selection is too limited for a beer city like Seattle, only three beers on drafts, two of them very light lagers and just one IPA. I like a bigger beer variety. The decoration and ambience were nice. But, overall, not a good value restaurant.
Stateside;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/stateside-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=0;Paige G.;3;1/18/2019;17;WA;Was OK, but really overpriced. I will not be going back or recommending to others.

I decided to dine at Stateside. I must emphasize that this restaurant provided us with one of the most exceptional customer experiences we've encountered since our move in August.Food QualityAs avid food enthusiasts, we love exploring diverse items on the menu. Here's what we had: Crispy Duck Fresh Rolls, Ahi Tuna Crudo, Sticky Rice Dumplings, Crunchy and Creamy Chili-Garlic Prawns, and Goat Curry.Firstly, I anticipated the Crispy Duck Fresh Rolls to be heavy, but they pleasantly surprised me. The meat quantity was just right and seasoned to perfection. The Ahi Tuna, while the fish was high-quality, suffered an excess of saltiness that overpowered the overall dish.Next, the Sticky Rice Dumplings had too much of a chewy or gummy texture. However, the savory flavors, particularly the mushrooms, compensated for this drawback. The prawns, generously sized and lightly breaded, provided an awesome crunchy texture. Lastly, the Goat Curry not only smelled amazing but also lived up to its tasty expectations. The curry maintained a thickness, avoiding excessive liquidity. Regrettably, we set aside the tuna and dumplings, choosing not to finish them.Customer ServiceOur server, Michael, left a lasting mark on our dining experience. His profound knowledge of the menu, coupled with his friendly and attentive demeanor, was impressive. Midway through our meal, he noticed our hesitation with the two dishes we had set aside and kindly prompted for our feedback. He listened to our concerns which led to a thoughtful replacement of the dumplings with the Crispy Mushroom Fresh Rolls, a suggestion that did not disappoint! Michael's exceptional service exceeded our expectations, which has become rare in our dining experiences, and we truly appreciated it. As a result, I've decided to give this restaurant a well-earned 4-star rating. Will we be back? Absolutely.

My wife and I were very happy with our drinks. She had the lemongrass Manhattan and I had the cassia mule. My mule had a strong ginger taste, and I found it to be quite refreshing. We also shared the grilled pork collar and crispy chicken. The pork was pretty tasty, but definitely needed the sauces that are served on the side. Without the sauces, I think I would have been a little underwhelmed. And I felt that was even more the case with the chicken. While it was perfectly crispy, there didn't seem to be much seasoning and flavor to it. The sauce helped a bit, but I thought the dish could have been just a little better. Overall we had a very nice meal, and I certainly would go back again to try more dishes.

Stateside;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/stateside-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=20;Medha T.;5;6/21/2023;16;WA;Restaurant Review: Stateside - A Vietnamese Culinary DelightI recently had the pleasure of dining at Stateside, a Vietnamese restaurant that left a lasting impression with its innovative flavors and culinary craftsmanship. From the moment I entered, I knew I was in for a treat.Let's start with the appetizer, the mushroom summer rolls. These rolls were a testament to the creativity and innovation present at Stateside. The combination of mushrooms and fresh ingredients resulted in a burst of flavors that delighted my taste buds. Each bite was filled with freshness and the rolls were expertly crafted, showcasing the skill of the chefs in creating a unique and delicious dish.Moving on to the standout dish, the spicy shrimp, it unquestionably stole the show. The perfect balance of heat and flavors made it an instant favorite. In fact, we loved it so much that we ordered two servings for the table, and ended up ordering two more! The succulent shrimp were cooked to perfection, and the spicy sauce added a delightful kick that left us craving for more. It was undoubtedly the highlight of the menu.Next, we indulged in the goat curry. While the flavors were familiar, Stateside managed to elevate the dish to new heights. The curry was expertly prepared, and the goat was tender and infused with the aromatic spices. The dish was a symphony of flavors, transporting us to the streets of Vietnam with every mouthful.We also had the pleasure of savoring the fish and noodles dish, which was a delightful combination of freshness and taste. The fish was cooked to perfection, flaky and moist, while the noodles provided a satisfying texture. The flavors were vibrant and well-balanced, showcasing the attention to detail in each component of the dish.However, one area where Stateside could improve is in providing more vegetarian options. While the mushroom summer rolls were a fantastic choice, those seeking a meatless meal might find limited options on the menu. Expanding the vegetarian offerings would attract a wider range of diners and cater to various dietary preferences.On to the beverages, I ordered the coconut drink, and it was a delightful surprise. The innovative presentation, coupled with the refreshing taste of coconut, created a truly enjoyable drinking experience. It was evident that Stateside took pride in crafting unique and delightful beverages that complemented the culinary journey.Lastly, the dessert was an indulgent finale to the meal. Though the details were not provided, the decadent nature of the dessert speaks volumes. Stateside clearly knows how to satisfy one's sweet tooth and provide a memorable ending to the dining experience.Overall, Stateside is a Vietnamese restaurant that stands out for its innovative flavors and culinary expertise. From the mushroom summer rolls to the exceptional spicy shrimp and well-executed goat curry, the dishes were a testament to the skill and passion of the chefs. While vegetarian options could be expanded, the flavors and overall experience were undeniably delightful. Coupled with the innovative coconut drink and decadent desserts, Stateside offers a Vietnamese culinary journey that is worth embarking upon.

Stateside;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/stateside-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=20;Michael B.;5;01-03-2019;1;MT;I rated this restaurant a few years ago and returned during the Holidays in December 2018. Much of the menu has changed, but new flavors were as interesting and delicious as before. I think the only repeats were the duck rolls and the chili cumin ribs which were just as amazing as before. We had a party of 5 adults and 2 children (adventurous eaters) and shared everything family style. We had the mushroom rolls, the pork collar, the masterstock crispy chicken, goat curry, clam rice, tamarind braised short ribs, flowering cauliflower, jasmine and ginger rice, salt cured duck egg, and the cha ca la vong. For desert we split all the items on the menu. Everything was very delicious and the salt cured duck egg added a salty creaminess to every dish I pared it with. The short ribs and the cumin ribs were my favorite with a close second being the masterstock crispy chicken and the pork collar. My favorite desert was the duck/goose egg custard. The service was top-notch and our server and the owner answered all the questions we had about the menu. This being the second time, I would say that it still remains the pinnacle of my dining experiences. I would recommend anything on the menu.

The food is an excellent combination of the fresh vibrant flavors of vietnamese food as well as the rich layered flavors seen in excellent french dishes. The pumpkin curry and beet tartar with buttered cilantro toast were amazing vegetarian choices as well as the pork ribs thrown in cumin seed and chili flakes almost fell off the bone. The decor includes a minty colour palette, classic tropical background and distressed mirrors. Though this eatery is in the center of the active Pike-Pine corridor, it somehow feels comfy and tucked away. I'll definitely be going back to Stateside. Outstanding!!!

Really more French-Vietnamese than traditional Vietnamese, this place is fantastic. Somewhat limited menu, but truly one that rings of ""quality over quantity"". The setting is very nice, even though the restaurant space was originally a garage. Service was great despite it being busy. Everybody who's been here has probably tried the cumin pork ribs, which are very potent (don't get it if you hate cumin). Also got frog legs and master stock chicken, both of which really packed in the flavor. The chicken is a very safe bet, but this is the kind of place where you should definitely try go beyond your conservative palate. Can't go wrong with any of the desserts (my personal favorite was the frozen cinnamon souffle, so cinnaminny). Would definitely go again, and it's certainly a good place to share with friends."

Marination Ma Kai;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/marination-ma-kai-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Mike W.;1;2/21/2021;7;WA;Absolutely terrible Seafood. I was looking forward to trying it out for once. The fish tastes like Gordon fisherman quality. The fries were over cooked and they only give you two smaller pieces of fish that did not taste that good at all. I think Gorton's fisherman fish taste better than this crap. Don't mean to be harsh however when do you expect good quality seafood in the Pacific Northwest and you get this that's worse than frozen food quality fish. This is the first and last time I'll ever go here unless there is a big change.

The service is generally fine, with the staff being friendly and attentive.However, I've had hair in my food multiple times, which raises serious concerns about their cleanliness and food safety practices. This repeated issue is disappointing and needs urgent attention.After this last instance, I probably will be staying away for a while. It's a shame because the food and service are great, but until the cleanliness issues are addressed, I can't see myself returning.

Sorry the Loco Moco price is outrageous. It should be worth $4.25. Only one hamburger pattie. Also, its just a plain hamburger pattie not mixed with onions or worcestershire sauce.

Marination Ma Kai;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/marination-ma-kai-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Clam S.;3;05-03-2023;18;WA;I recently visited Marination Ma Kai and left a bit disappointed. The portions were definitely not Hawaii sized, and the food was just okay - the teriyaki chicken wasn't anything special or groundbreaking. If I did have to go back I'd get the kimchi fried rice.The menu also didn't wow me with Hawaiian options, so I wouldn't put Marination in my top three favorite Hawaiian restaurants. If you're looking for great Hawaiian food, try Kona Kitchen or Kauai Family Restaurant instead.
Marination Ma Kai;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/marination-ma-kai-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;John D.;3;8/15/2022;13;WA;I loved the location of this restaurant as its just next to the ferry terminal. The food is good but a bit on the salty side, especially the Spam Musubi. Aloha Fries, Malasadas and Shave Ice are highly recommended. Overall, it was a good experience.
Marination Ma Kai;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/marination-ma-kai-seattle?not_recommended_start=10;Ron M.;3;6/29/2022;11;WA;The location can't be better - right off the water taxi dock with a view of the Seattle skyline. Marination Ma Kai has an outdoor patio but to really sit waterfront, you just use one of the public picnic tables.The food was good, hearty and tasty. I had a Loco Moco (beef patty with two sunny side up eggs on gravy and white rice ), which is flavorful but a little bit on the small side for a real meal. So I also had four tacos (I wish I could just have two but they only do four tacos during the week), which are good too. There are five protein options to mix and match including tofu.However, the whole fast food, self serve vibe makes me wonder if it's worth the big bucks. There are even flies flying around in the utensil area.

Food is small to modest size, so don't worry if you can't decide....get two items. We ordered kimchi fried rice, loco Mosco and fish and chips to share for 2 people. Perfect! Everything had great flavor. Fish and chips were tender and not too heavily breaded. Look forward to returning.

The slaw, sauces and onions merry with pork and bun for a perfect bite each time.It filled me up plenty for lunch.Atmosphere was very relaxed and scenery was beautiful. Wait wasn't long at all.

Islander style on some American classics and Hawaiian comfort food. The Katsu sandwich is also a good choice if your hungry. That thing is huge. The kimchi fried rice was a generous serving and the tacos were the size of street tacos. The fish tacos were also very delicious and had a miso sake glaze on it, then grilled. Everything is bursting with flavor and the portions make sure no one hits the ferry hungry. The environment is nice, family friendly and very relaxing. Definitely would recommend coming here! Hit the spot and can't wait to go again! Great view of the city too.

D'uh, 'nuff said and they have me coming here over and over. Get some tacos, add some sriracha, the fish n chips are delicious, mac salad is the best I've had in Seattle compared to the Real Hawaiian stuff, and they have plenty of crispy cold lagers available so you don't have to grow your beard any further with IPA (unless you want to, they do have them).

A must do experience if you've never been, and a great place to take visitors to Seattle. Sit on the patio with a local microbrew and some tacos or sliders and look across the water at the incredible Seattle skyline. Located right at the water taxi dock, so even if you're in Seattle it's worth the trip and is a great day out. You can even rent kayaks and paddle boards from the booth located on the street side of the building and make a full day of it. Highly recommended

Copine;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/copine-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Irene X.;1;09-02-2024;1;CA;I usually never write reviews for restaurants because I'm too lazy, but this time I'm so frustrated that I feel compelled to leave a negative review. I recently dined at this restaurant, and unfortunately, the experience was far from pleasant. The food was very mediocre. It seemed like the restaurant was trying to be creative with the presentation, but the taste was really hit or miss.The real issue, however, came at the end of the meal. When the check arrived, we noticed that our bill had almost doubled, so we pointed this out to our server. If we hadn't caught this, we would have overpaid significantly. When we pointed out the mistake, the server didn't seem genuinely sorry or take the proper steps to correct it. He just returned the original bill with a refunded amount, without providing a corrected receipt or a new printout. As a result, we had to do the calculations ourselves to figure out the final total and calculate the tip, which made us feel like we were responsible for fixing his mistake.Overall, I'm very disappointed with the whole experience. It ruined what was supposed to be a great night. I wouldn't recommend this place unless they improve both their food and customer service.

We were seated immediately & had a nice table. It was pretty crowded & noisy but that didn't bother us, as we can be a little noisy, too. Got our menus & were a little surprised & disappointed that there really wasn't anything that we usually think of as brunch type food. They make their own bread there so where was the French Toast or even egg dishes? There were a lot of things that had some pretty unusual ingredients & one actually had a fried or poached egg on top, but most of our group was not impressed with the menu. The one thing that was actually very good (and that had been recommended to us) was the avocado toast. It was delicious, but had way too much garnishing on top which was pretty, but not really necessary & just got in the way. I probably would have gone with a 3 rating, except the service was not especially good. There were several wait staff hanging around a center service area chatting (including our server) but trying to get their attention when a couple of our guests didn't receive their full order was difficult. This place has a lot of good things going for them...if they would just not try to impress people with their fancy menu.

The wait can vary from 10 min to 40 min. The food presentation is pretty and the visual atmosphere is pleasant. However, I agree with many of the other reviewers in terms of overall unprofessional service that needs an upgrade. Once we were seated, we were not offered a menu or water for the first 10 min. The server never introduced herself and she forgot one of our order. Even though there was a long line of people waiting, we didn't get a check and had to finally ask a different server. In general the servers need to smile and be more courteous. I heard one server bad - mouthing one of their table which is so unprofessional and made the experience uncomfortable. I wouldn't buy anything in there item and flower wise since it is so overpriced but the food was delicious and I would come back...I would tentatively recommend this place because I think service can be changed with better management.  P.S. try the tea cake and avocado albacore. Salmon lox portion was ridiculously small for the price. Ice tea is nothing special. Quiche on the first day was divine, second day very gooey. Don't get the scrambled egg, it's rubbery.

They serve classic, no-frills breakfast meals cooked, seasoned, and baked to perfection. Their Farm Egg Omelette is one of the best, and by far the simplest, omelettes I've had at a restaurant, and their croissant was flaky, crispy, chewy, and buttery deliciousness.

We came for dinner on a Tuesday so it wasn't as busy. I'm sure I'm a regular weekend night there would be a lot more people and wait. Drinks were great, but the food was lacking a little flavor, the Cajun shrimp was all breading more than anything. It was all still pretty good over all, but I wouldn't say it's southern Louisiana flavors for sure.

Bar Harbor;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/bar-harbor-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;C L.;1;11/22/2020;1;CA;terrible runny tasteless clam chowder.
Bar Harbor;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/bar-harbor-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Jamie M.;1;6/13/2019;6;WA;I'm very disappointed and upset at how the security is managed at your building. They do nothing about the half naked drunks that ramble out of the bar within or the drug addicts, pot smokers, heroin users on the property or the fact that there is a person that repeatedly sleeps in the gas main cubby whole, but for some reason when someone wants to smoke a cigarette in the alley they are constantly scrutinized. The landscapers and power washers are also disrespectful by consistently blowing all the trash from one side of the alley to the other, instead of removing it. For this being such a high cost building, with such high end tenants you would think that there would be a higher grade of professionalism.
Bar Harbor;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/bar-harbor-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Rudy W.;3;02-09-2018;6;WA;Limited menu, based around New England cuisine.

Our bartender is incredibly likeable and so so friendly. He is the reason I felt compelled to write a review. He remembered my parents and their drink order from a few weeks ago, and even remembered that they were here celebrating a birthday. He is nothing but helpful, and he even offered waters to two ladies who said they were killing time standing in the bar when he knew he wouldn't get any business from them. All of the other staff have been cheery and fun so far as well.Apart from the service, the kimchi bloody marys are yummy! $11 apiece is alright, definitely worth how good they are. They have an awesome craft cocktail menu too, can't wait to come back for more!Lastly, the views from the bar are delightful!
Bar Harbor;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/bar-harbor-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Andrew S.;5;12-07-2023;43;FL;"If you're roaming around Seattle and craving some legit Boston vibes, check out Bar Harbor in SLU. It's like a little East Coast pocket in the city. The lobster rolls? Seriously good stuff - fresh, tasty, and hits the spot every time.They've got a solid selection of canned beers too. Doesn't matter if you're into the usual suspects or wanna try something new, they've probably got a can for that.So, next time you're in SLU and thinking seafood and a chill beer, give Bar Harbor a shot. It's laid-back, friendly, and does the Boston seafood thing right in Seattle."""

I have been waiting for these lobster rolls for months and was not disappointed. The roll itself is incredible, and the lobster portion is perfect. I also had the chowder which is a traditional New England style thin chowder instead of the thick Northwest style and I have to say, the east coasters do it better. The burrata salad was out of this world as well. The place is gorgeous and the whole staff seems really happy to be there. I went in on day one, so there are some minor kinks to work out, but that is just practice. Can't wait for the oysters!

We showed up right at opening and were the first ones seated. Service was great - the bartender even came over to discuss our cocktails which was a first at any restaurant I've been to.We have loved Jerry Traunfeld's Poppy and ate ate Herbfarm when he was there as well. Dinner was very good overall. We were able to order off of their special gluten free menu which luckily had more than just a couple items. Not an easy thing to do in an Asian cuisine restaurant generally.The numbing vs spicy concept was thankfully explained well by our server. Numb tongue was another first for me! Not quite sure how I felt about it but the flavors of the food we dined on were overall exceptional.

Joule;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/joule-seattle?not_recommended_start=10;Nick G.;3;02-03-2010;161;WA;Joule has a great story behind it. A French husband and an Asian wife cooking together in the kitchen for the perfect blend of perfection. Not so much. While the concept and the menu seemed to be noteworthy the customer service was average and the crab dish and corn bread was all together quite bland to me although I did find a slight glimmer of hope in taste testing my girlfriend's Mackerel. The truth is, to succeed in the food business around the Seattle area you have to:a) Either have EXTREMELY good customer service where people leave the restaurant feeling like they were a part of your family.b) Have EXTREMELY good food, customer service optional at this point.Neither a nor b ring true at Joule. Still looking for a real Jewel to dine at in Wallingford.
Joule;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/joule-seattle?not_recommended_start=10;Lesly S.;4;06-07-2024;5;NV;First and foremost, the service was excellent. Since we didn't have a reservation, we sat at the bar counter. Our bartender was phenomenal, expertly guiding us through the menu.Now, let's talk about the food! The spicy rice cakes are an absolute must-try--they're simply delicious. While the steak was a bit too greasy for my taste, it was still tender and flavorful.

Joule;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/joule-seattle?not_recommended_start=10;Brian P.;4;07-08-2017;106;WA;"I think Joule is a strong 3.5 stars but based on my total experience with the place I'm giving it four. I was very excited about this place a couple years ago - several meals I had were outstanding with really innovative dishes and outstanding execution. But I went back for dinner a few nights ago and would say for the most part the meal was just good. I'm kinda tired of paying through the nose for good so probably won't be back for a while. Two standout dishes were the Korean rice cakes with chorizo (and I've always been very happy with how Joule handles rice cake dishes) and the black bean eggplant with garlic. Really stunning and exciting flavors here. The rest - and we had a bunch of other small plates - was just good. The kaya toast (boring, spread was boring too), white stuffed Kim chi ""cake"" (which all tasted like a conventional pickle), bone marrow (giant bone with little marrow but the flavor was good), black sesame noodle (I was expecting a better cold noodle salad. This one lost something in translation; my local QFC makes a tastier Sesame noodle salad...) and I believe we had wagyu skirt steak with pineapple slaw (nice meat, cooked well, just good) was all just good. It was good. Not great. Not excellent. Not amazing. Can someone point me to a restaurant that will consistently delight and dazzle me without requiring a mortgage payment in ransom? Thanks."

Excellent atmosphere. Great for weekend brunch. For $19 you can pick one entree + get a free for all at the buffet. For DINNER, however, portions are lacking in size.

The rice cakes are a must order. The octopus fell a little flat despite ordering it based on a great review of it. The steak was probably the best order. It was their signature short rib steak and it was truly amazing. The greens we ordered with the steak were also money. The cauliflower was just okay. Overall great place for Korean fusion steak. The bar was pretty good to sit at.
Joule;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/joule-seattle?not_recommended_start=20;Medha T.;5;04-11-2023;16;WA;I recently visited a restaurant that left a lasting impression on me. From the moment I walked in, the service was prompt, attentive, and friendly. The server provided excellent suggestions, making my dining experience even more enjoyable.Now let's talk about the food - I started with Chinese scallion pancakes, a simple dish executed to perfection. The pancakes were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a subtle yet satisfying flavor.Next up was the tofu steak, which was so delicious that it could convert even the most ardent tofu hater into a tofu lover. The dish was perfectly paired with mushrooms, creating a wonderful umami flavor that lingered on the tongue.Moving on to the rice cakes, I was blown away by the great pairing with the house-made chorizo. The dish had a delectable taste with great flavors and textures that complemented each other well.The Dan Dan noodles were a simple dish that couldn't go wrong. They were cooked to perfection with just the right balance of spice and flavor.Last but certainly not least was the showstopper dish, the short ribs. These were undoubtedly the star of the show, juicy and tender with a perfect balance of flavors. The gochujang spice added a pleasant kick to the dish, making it a truly memorable experience.Overall, the restaurant surpassed my expectations, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent dining experience. The exceptional service and outstanding dishes are sure to leave a lasting impression on anyone who visits.

Jose's Campfire is my favorite cocktail (tequila infused with lapsang souchong for a smoky flavor). The Joulebox dessert is the perfect blend of sweet, sour, crunchy, and smooth. Sharing 5 dishes between 3 people, or 3 dishes between two (plus the Joulebox for dessert!) usually does us right.

We had just about everything on the menu and were astounded by the brilliant combination of flavors. The smoked tofu was mindblowing and delicious. The grits rich and tasty and the lamb left me hunting for more. The service was impeccable, the decor soothing, and all in all it was one of the best meals I have ever had. Joule is everything I love about seattle--cross cultural, innovative, and fun.I cant wait to go back.And FYI, these chefs just opened a second restaurant in Seattle, Revel. It is just as tasty as Joule but at a more casual affordable price.

Cactus Restaurants;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cactus-restaurants-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=0;Alex A.;3;10-03-2020;8;WA;"As a Latinx, I just can't believe that people would dine at a place that serves NON-authentic Mexican food. For Seattle, American and Asian food is great, but decent and fantastic Latinx food is actually difficult to find in the city. Upon my visit at Cactus in South Lake Union, I ordered a few things. The margaritas and tequila shots were pretty good, but what really threw me off was their ""Camarones Del Diablo"". In Spanish, that means ""Deviled Shrimp"", and I was expecting quite a spicy kick to the flavor. Although it was dim lighting, the plate was served with battered shrimp at the top and coleslaw underneath, with a sweet sauce on the side. I originally thought the coleslaw was white rice until I took a bite. I swear I was eating a combination of southern food (coleslaw) and sweet and sour chicken (shrimp with the sauce), and I was highly disappointed. I help run a restaurant in the Yakima area and our ""Camarones a la Diabla"" will always be superior to this (our plate is served with shrimp drenched in a fiery sauce, rice, and salad). In the end, the staff was professional and timely with our food, as it was a busy Friday night."
Cactus Restaurants;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cactus-restaurants-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=0;Kristina A.;3;8/29/2016;19;WA;The food at Cactus is good - not great. The drinks at Cactus are good - not great. Especially the margarita. A good margarita goes a long way in my book, and I'm always disappointed.

The dining areas are spacious and the seating is comfortable. The staff members are friendly and attentive, providing excellent service throughout the meal.The menu at Cactus Restaurants offers a variety of dishes inspired by Mexican cuisine, with a modern and creative twist. The ingredients are fresh and high-quality, and the dishes are well-prepared and flavorful.One of the standout dishes I tried was the tacos al pastor, which were made with juicy and tender pork, marinated in a flavorful blend of spices and served with fresh salsa and guacamole. The ceviche was also delicious, with fresh seafood and tangy citrus flavors.The drink menu at Cactus Restaurants is also impressive, with a wide selection of tequilas and cocktails. The margaritas are particularly popular and well-made, with a perfect balance of sweetness and tartness.The dessert menu is also worth mentioning, with a variety of sweet treats to choose from. The tres leches cake was particularly delicious, with a moist and creamy texture.Overall, Cactus Restaurants is a great option for those looking for flavorful and modern Mexican cuisine in a fun and lively atmosphere.

The fact that it is smothered in sauce and has guacamole on the side - yum. I will probably order this every time I come here because I know how delicious it is, plus its a good size meal.

I highly recommend the Grilled Jalapeños, which are stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in bacon - delicious! I've taken my family several times, and even my very picky 12 yr old daughter has enjoyed everything she's ordered. For the most part, our service has been great. It can be a little noisy, but that's too be expected from a busy restaurant. My only real complaint about this place is that it has a very corporate vibe, kinda like a large chain.

Cactus Restaurants;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cactus-restaurants-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=60;Kevlyn R.;5;06-06-2013;2;WA;This is my ABSOLUTE favorite place. I have only been to two, the one on Madison Park and the one on Alki. The one on Madison Park has a really cool atmosphere inside with hanging pepper lanterns. Its one of those places I loved instantly because of the feel. I have been a Cactus regular for almost three years now. I suggest the Alki Cactus on those nice days when you want to be close to the beach and even have a view of the beach!The food is very reasonably priced. My favorites are the seafood enchilada, fish tacos, enchilada verdes, and butternut squach enchillada. By boyfriend also LOVES this place. Their Margaritas are awesome. I took a risk last summer and tried one of their seasonal margaritas (watermelon actually) and it too was AMAZING! I cannot say enough good things about this place. I have gone many times and never have I ever been disappointed by the service or the food. Plus who doesn't love free chips and salsa? THANK YOU CACTUS!!!

The Chicken Supply;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-chicken-supply-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Matt L.;5;08-10-2024;16;WA;Here's a 5-star Yelp review for The Chicken Supply in Seattle based on the quality of their chicken:---**Rating:** **Review:**I've had my fair share of fried chicken, but The Chicken Supply in Seattle has taken my love for this comfort food to a whole new level. From the moment I walked in, I knew I was in for something special. The aroma alone had my mouth watering, and let me tell you, the taste did not disappoint!The chicken here is hands down the best I've ever had. Each piece is perfectly crispy on the outside, with a golden, crunchy coating that's just the right thickness. But the real magic happens when you take that first bite--the chicken inside is tender, juicy, and bursting with flavor. It's seasoned to perfection, with a balance of spices that complements the meat without overpowering it.I tried both their classic fried chicken and their spicy option, and both were phenomenal. The spicy chicken has just the right amount of kick, enough to keep things interesting but not so much that it overwhelms the palate. Plus, the portion sizes are generous, so you really get your money's worth of chicken. Beyond the food, the service was top-notch. The staff was friendly, attentive, and clearly passionate about what they do. You can tell they take pride in serving up some of the best chicken in Seattle.I will say we did take the food to go so I'm not sure how it is eating inside. It seems like a small space with a few table but enough for a quick bite. If you're a fried chicken lover, The Chicken Supply is a must-visit. I can't recommend it enough. I'll definitely be back to get my fried chicken fix!
The Chicken Supply;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-chicken-supply-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Lori S.;5;1/27/2024;6;WA;Absolutely the best fried chicken I have ever had! Great side dishes. Must order the night before after 9PM. Great service.
The Chicken Supply;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-chicken-supply-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Leo F.;5;09-11-2023;10;WA;Do not sleep in this place. Being a fan of fried chicken, I was surprised at how big the chicken pieces were. I ordered a variety of each. I was on my way home with my order and couldn't wait because it smelled so good! I was the crazy driver who was drinking drumsticks with one hand and driving with the other. The leftover chicken was still crispy! And that they were bomb on the sides and full of flavor too! The garlic rice was wrapped in crispy chicken skin and dipped in a coconut sauce from the greens. Although the meat stick was soggy by the time I got home, it was still very flavorful. One of the best places for chicken in Seattle. Last but not least, the butter mochi cake was chewy and paired so well with the coconut chips that I ate it in one sitting, despite thinking I would have leftovers the next day. . Because it was big enough.
The Chicken Supply;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-chicken-supply-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Tiffany K.;5;9/30/2022;38;CA;WOW AMAZING. Even if it wasn't gluten free, it's probably the best fried chicken I've ever had. I like both the spicy and the original and recommend the thigh and drumstick. I honestly didn't like the chicken breast stick or the pancit. The pancit had no flavor it was just vegetables and noodles I don't know if it was supposed to come with sauce. The monggo beans and rice is SO GOOD for those who like beans. The butter mochi is the best I've ever had and the cream that comes with it is amazing. The garlic rice is incredible. This is one of those rare places that does everything well even if I didn't like their pancit or chicken breast stick. The potatoes were super good and crips but they were really salty. I'd still get them again.
The Chicken Supply;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-chicken-supply-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Raven M.;5;05-07-2022;1;CA;Best. Chicken. Ever.Thank you Paolo and your awesome crew for an amazing meal!!
The Chicken Supply;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-chicken-supply-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Martin S.;5;10/17/2021;2;WA;The Chicken Supply just opened for business and I was happy to check out their offerings. My usual fried chicken spot is Heaven Sent in Lake City, but it will be nice to have a place that is closer to my normal work commutes. They are to-go only at the moment and everything traveled well between the time I picked up and when I sat down to eat.Don't forget about the sides when ordering. I can't speak for the owners, but to me it seems as though they are more interested in offering a balanced meal, both in nutrition and flavor profiles, than just selling as much chicken as possible. Of course, with everything purchased piecemeal, that's up to you.The fried chicken had a crisp, spicy (but not too spicy!) and a little sweet exterior, with a moist flavorful interior. Delicious.I tried a few of the sides and my favorite was the Cold Pancit. A light, glass noodle salad who's acidity, especially the bites with cherry tomato, paired perfectly with the heat from the fried chicken.The Coconut Collard Greens were also great, not the standard collard green side that you'll find at fried chicken places. The distinct flavor of collard greens was still there, just muted a bit by the coconut broth and everything else that it cooked in. I didn't do it this time, but it would go great on a pile of rice.I'm also a sucker for pickled vegetables of all types and the Marinated Veggies did not disappoint. A nice medley of veggies, providing different textures to each sweetly marinated bite. Highly recommended.
Zig Zag Cafe;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0;Jimmy Y.;1;1/20/2017;5;WA;Shit service! The waiter ignored us like we dont exist! And the food was horrible and service is very slow

Zig Zag Cafe;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0;E T.;1;8/19/2013;39;WA;Way too expensive for what you get.I didnt go here for happy hour and everything was really overpriced. The waitresses were rude and slow and my mixed drink was really gross. Our table ordered some olives and it took 30 min to get them. Guess I need to come during happy hour but the cocktails are just really bad. Everybody at my table hated their drink.

Zig Zag Cafe;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0;Eric M.;4;05-03-2018;2;CA;This place is still the standard setter in my book. The new guy making the cocktails behind the counter (I believe his name was Gerardo, or was it Alejandro?) is awesome, and of course Erik and Ben are top notch, as usual. They also know how to treat their customers. I was dropping by on a Friday down in the dumps about my hard disk failing. Came out a little tipsy but VERY much ready to get on with it. Awesome drinks that put you out of whatever mood you're in, and that's hard to do. Usually stuff tastes nasty if you are in a bad mood. Not so here. They know what they are doing.
Zig Zag Cafe;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=10;Ronald E.;4;02-11-2018;90;CA;What a nice place to have some quality time with your loved ones.

Zig Zag Cafe;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=20;Royal B.;4;4/21/2016;9;WA;This is my favourite cocktail area in the city. The setting is fantastic - intimate and amazing but not cheesy, and pretty much anything on the drink menu is good. For the food, I felt the cheese platter proved to be a fine compliment in the event you are going the wine course. In the event you are up for it, purchase the Spanish Coffee and take pleasure in the show.
Zig Zag Cafe;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=20;Mack W.;4;04-11-2016;8;WA;I went with a buddy, we sat at the pub and described kind of drinks we enjoy to the bartender, and he combined one up for each of us. Truly he followed that with a couple more, on the home. If we did not enjoy one, he'd take it back and start over. I am unsure how much of this had to do with my buddy's flirting skill, but I 'd undoubtedly not write this spot off as 'poor drinks.' This really isn't the place to go with a large group. Go with only one other man, when it is not overly active, sit up at the pub, and really speak with the bartender.
Zig Zag Cafe;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=20;Another G.;4;7/14/2015;102;WA;Not bad at all. Good drinks and ok food for Happy hour. Had a good time and the place was nice. Will definitely go back.

Zig Zag Cafe;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=30;Joe D.;4;02-11-2012;4;WA;Ok, so...some friends suggested we go here. When I told them I'd never heard of it, well, let's just say I was almost ousted from the group. After all the hubub, I was surprised that it wasn't that busy on a Saturday night. There is a really dim, cozy feel to the place. Our bartender was Eric, and his drinks were fantastic. The food is some of the best I've had at a bar, the pizza in particular was surpsingly good.If this place was a little closer to home. I'd go more. But I'll definitely be back!
Zig Zag Cafe;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=30;Nick G.;4;12/17/2009;161;WA;When other people say that this place is hard to find... they're right. The easiest way to find it is to drive as if you're right in front of Pike Place Market and take the first left which you start going down the hill. You'll see the sky-bridge and you park and get out of your car. Walk to the right and you'll see some steps that go down... it will be on your right.I loved the vibe of the place. Very eclectic atmosphere where young and old will both feel at home. Their drink list is VERY unique and the liquor was too strong for our taste. My girlfriend typically likes fruity cocktail drinks whereas the majority of their drinks were a lot stronger if you know what I mean. We even saw absinthe on the menu and contemplated drinking some but the thought of hallucinating to the State Puff Marshmallow over the Space Needle didn't sound good at the time. Great vibe if you're looking for a chill place to relax in downtown Seattle.
Zig Zag Cafe;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=30;Reiko k.;4;11-05-2009;10;WA;LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! The drink menu is truly innovative, Mr. Bartender man has been running this place for ages and you can clearly tell. The service is kind of bland from the server end, but they mind their own business and are fast and efficient. The menu is nice as well...the meat platter was really filling and I love that they serve dinner until 1am!
Zig Zag Cafe;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=30;Luke J.;4;8/19/2008;15;WA;I can't say enough good things about this place! The cocktails are amazing, the wine/beer/liquor lists are phenomenal, and the food is great! Sure, it might take a few minutes to get your drink, but it's totally worth the wait - perfection in a glass, every time. Go when Murray is working, and if he has a free moment, pick his brain about whatever booze you think you know a lot about - he'll put you to shame with his knowledge! He's amazing!

I've never had hummus like this before. I also had a couple other small bites but nothing compared to what the hummus tasted like!Absolutely loved the ambiance. Lighting is romantic. Service was superb! They had a list full of yummy libations!! I had the French 75 (not on the menu) and the RBF. It's definitely a great place to meet up, have a drink and chit chat with some friends! We had an emergency phone call from back home and had to deal with it right away so I didn't have a chance to try anything else. Overall, this was one of my favorite restaurants/bars in Seattle.
Zig Zag Cafe;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=40;Jillian M.;5;11-02-2018;12;WA;"Came here on a Saturday night after dinner for some drinks around 9 pm. It wasn't busy at all and we got seats by the bar immediately; however, it did get pretty crowded by the time we left at 11 pm. It's also a bit confusing to find as it's tucked away in the stairwell; it's easy to misread a sign that directs you to the ""2nd level,"" so naturally you go up a flight of stairs. If you go up the stairs, you'll run into some homeless folks shooting up in a dark walkway.Overall, I'm a fan of their drinks as they were well crafted. The bartenders are really nice and know the right liquor to bitters to juice ratio. The vibe was very intimate with the dim lighting and soft music playing in the background. It was a pleasant, low-key evening."

By the time it was my turn to order, I was stuck. Our lovely server guided me with just a couple of questions to the perfect off-menu cocktail and it was beyond delicious. How the bartender married my two preferences for whiskey and grapefruit, I'll never remember. But the memory of this experience will bring me back to Seattle time and time again. It doesn't get better than this. Thanks Zig Zag!

But for me what puts Zig Zag over the top is the high level of service. The staff makes even the ""greenest"" tourist feel like a regular the moment the pony up to the bar. Not in the mood for a fancy cocktail? Erik and co will happily pour you a beer and shot and tell you a raunchy joke. No pretension, no judgments, just a great time every time."

The drinks are very good, amazing even. This is even after the famous bartender that worked here left. He made me a very fine drink years ago which has proven impossible to emulate, despite my buying all of the ingredients I watched being put in including ouzo, retsina, and some other things written down on a napkin. The current bartenders seem to be equally skilled.

I normally go to a bar and get a beer or a vodka straight up. A trained monkey can serve that stuff, seriously. You go to Zig Zag and you are doing yourself a disservice by not taking advantage of the artists that are standing behind the bar. Shoot they got sterling bar instruments, crystal mixing glasses...it is pretty over the top.My brain did an overload looking at the bottles displayed on the wall so when it was my turn to order, I just told Eric, I believe, to make me something he likes.No clue what to call it buy he threw quite a bit of stuff in there...dak rum, bitters, mint, lime, a splash of somthing and a dash of another. It was really good. Cool atmosphere, like a throwback to a different error. Bartenders all dressed up and just a nice clean atmosphere.

Zig Zag Cafe;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=80;Robert H.;5;06-03-2008;5;WA;"Let's be blunt. If you ever see a book which claims to list the ""Top 10 Bars in the US""... if they don't include the Zig Zag, then they just frankly didn't do their research. Period. End Of Story.For me, the Zig Zag hits it out of the park on a variety of levels. To begin with, they are able to make the best cocktails you have ever had (more about that later). Their food is casual, relaxed, and unpretensious. I've had everything on their menu, and aside from the fact they leave the tails on the shrimp in their gumbo (pet peeve), I love everything. And they have such a wonderful bunch of regulars that it often feels like ""Cheers"" (everybody knows your name) when I drop in.On the cocktails...Reading through all of the reviews here, I see a few folk who appear to be scratching their heads when the rest of us are going on and on about the cocktails. It is a puzzlement.The Zig Zag takes pride in their cocktails, and for good reason. Their ""house list"" is one which shows off their craft at providing wonderfully exciting drinks that illustrate the culinary potential of the cocktail. I think the problem that many have, is that some of these drinks are perhaps not quite as ""approachable"" to the uninitiated.For any of you who have had a not-as-good-as-youd-like experience at the Zig Zag, here are two suggestions:Suggestion 1:Drop in from Tues-Fri, and early on, say between 5 and 7. Sit AT THE BAR. And don't look at the cocktail menu. Tell the bartender (Murray), what drink you normally like to drink, and what bar you think makes your favorite, and ask him if he has a recommendation. The drink you get will show you why we all rave about the Zig Zag.Suggestion 2. Make it a point to go there with me.-Robert ""DrinkBoy"" Hess"
Zig Zag Cafe;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=80;Sandy B.;5;3/28/2008;15;WA;"Murray is a wizard behind the bar. This is my top recommendation for delicious, sophisticated cocktails and just a great place to go to unwind and for conversation. It's tucked away in the hillclimb of the Pike Pace Market and it makes you feel like you're part of a private club since not everyone is in the ""know"" because it's off the beaten path.They have the biggest Whiskey and Brandy selection that I've found since I moved to Seattle. The menu is simple with sandwiches, salads and light snacks but they are really tasty."

The perfect spot for a date night,... pretty much any night. Everything about 84 Yesler is so well thought out, and perfect it executed. We ordered from the Chef's tasting menu, and added a wine pairing. Chef Sean and the sommelier Mike crafted a flawless 5-course meal that was built around our personal likes and dislikes. They seem to specialize in unexpected twists to their dishes that are creative without being too over the top- perfectly complimenting the dish without or distracting you from it. Their handmade pastas are perfect in every way, while fresh fish (seared fatty tuna!) and meats (lamb mushroom reduction!) were sublime. Service is attentive without being overbearing, and at just the right pace. This his our new regular go-to!

I work at Swedish in capital hill, and this is a super easy stop on my way home. I am all too often disappointed when going out to eat. So many places are just meh especially for what you pay. Here you get good food that's worth the price, but it's still at a moderate price point, so somewhere you can frequent more often. Will be back for more soon to try some of the other dishes!!!! Staff and culinary team are friendly, professional, and knowledgeable and you can tell take pride and pay careful attention in making your time there a culinary experience.

Rocco's;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=20;Sonja S.;2;1/22/2024;52;CA;I wanted to like it but it just wasn't that good. A cheese pizza for $50 should be fire but this wasn't. It was just okay, nothing special and the sauce was trash. I know great pizza and this wasn't that. I feel ripped off. I'd pass and go somewhere else if I were you.

Rocco's;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=20;Aaron W.;2;5/20/2017;5;WA;Ordered a couple slices of pizza and the pizza was delicious but the service was terrible.

Rocco's;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=20;Anthony L.;3;08-11-2019;44;CA;"Quality pizza, but super long wait time during lunch time did not leave a great first impression on me.The good: the servers and staffs were extremely friendly and polite. We were seated at a table first, when 2 minutes later the waiter realized the table was reserved already. He apologized and moved us to a different table, which was:  1. not a big deal at all  2. 10 feet away  3. a better table anywayNevertheless, he was super apologetic and gave us a $10 discount on our bill.The low: I came here with my co-workers for lunch, and we definitely did not expect the long wait time for food. After placing our order, we waited for at least 45 minutes before the food was ready. We didn't order anything special/customized either...my order was actually ""pizza by the slice"", which they literally just needed to grab from the counter and heat up. We did not leave with an excellent mood as we were hoping to grab a quick lunch and head back to work.The personal take: now onto the pizza itself. Personally, I'm a big NY style thin-slice pizza fan. I was excited when I saw that they have pizza by the slice option, which was not a common in the west coast. I was, however, disappointed after the long wait, as well as the food itself. It was definitely tasty, with a lot of ingredients, but unfortunately I set my expectation too high and was craving for the traditional NYC thin-slice style, and the pizza at Rocco's definitely wasn't that.Overall an average pizza place for me. I see that it got a lot of 5-star reviews, but for me, I prefer the thin-slice style, as well as a much faster serving pace."

Rocco's;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=30;Shameika S.;4;06-03-2019;581;TX;My friend and I were in Seattle for the weekend and just completed a little food tour at Pike Place market. After walking around Park Place and buying goods from other consumers wanted to go back home. But we were still hungry. We asked around about who had great pizza and everyone said Rocco's. When entering Rocco's I saw the pizza that everyone was talking about. There were so many different choices to choose from. I ended up getting a veggie pizza and a classic pepperoni. Our waiter was very nice and funny and the vibes in the music were A1. I think the best part that surprised me was at the drink menu was actually located inside of the cat in the hat book. Friendly service and great pizza. [Review 79 for 2019. Review 521 overall]

Looking inside there didn't appear to be air conditioning and the pizzas looked tiny. We decided to bail and find somewhere else.Looking on Yelp there was another place a few blocks away so off we went to have a look. What a great quirky pizza place! Huge pies, excellent attentive service, a great atmosphere and a fully loaded bar.Highly recommended if you have a craving for pizza in Seattle!

Although this is a temple of fine dining, the service was friendly and unpretentious. Food was perfectly prepared, and deliciously flavorful. (I had a Chilled Peekytoe Crab Salad, Poached Halibut with ""Black Truffle Pot-au-Feu"" and Hazelnut Marshmallow desert.) We were seated in the corner in a curved banquette that gave us both a great ""people watching"" view of the beautiful dining room.

Rocco's;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=40;Nelson M.;4;07-10-2014;4;WA;Let me preface this review by saying I'm not crazy about pizza. But this place is quite tasty. like the pizza, but the prices are a tad bit expensive. 40$ for a large pie is a a lot.
Rocco's;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=40;Evangeline R.;4;09-11-2012;11;WA;Great service. Great decor. Decent pizza. Glad to have this in Belltown.
Rocco's;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=40;Laura L.;4;09-06-2012;12;NY;"I was visiting my daughter who lives in Seattle last week.I desperately needed to find a place that serves good pizza and tried out Rocco's after perusing restaurants on Yelp. Now let me be clear on this...I would give Rocco's 5 stars but I noticed on Yelp that a five star rating gets kicked to the ""filtered"" catagory so I opted for4 stars to be safe. I actually read the filtered reviews and decided to give this place a try and I am glad I did. I too am from New York so I have high standards for pizza. Rocco's did not disappoint. The crust was thin and crisp and the sauce had a fresh, home made taste. I dont know why previous reviewers were so negative about this place. The decor is very unique and sophisticated ..not a typical pizza joint atmosphere. I cant review the shrub drinks since I stuck with wine, but the bar is fully equipped and the drinks I saw being made looked wonderful. My wine was a generous amount for the price and paired well with the salad I ordered. The greens were crisp and flavorful and the salad was lightly dressed as I had requested. The service was top notch and the wait staff was able to answer all my questions regarding the menu. I find this commendable for a restaurant that has only recently opened. A lot of the reviews on Yelp seem to love to nit pick a business (perhaps a result of our reality TV mind set) and I have read unfair reviews of restaurants and businesses that I frequent in my hometown of Saratoga, NY. After having excellent food and service in a classy, sophisticated restaurant like Rocco's I feel that people should be presented with a more accurate appraisal of the place. The negative reviews sound like they are written by competitors. I am glad I read the filtered reviews, otherwise I would not have chosen to dine at Rocco's. Incidentally, my daughter and her friends agree with my assessment since they accompanied me during dinner. Read the filtered reviews, people, and maybe you will agree that the publishedreviews sure seem to be prejudiced and perhaps inaccurate."
Rocco's;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=40;Caroline X.;5;04-08-2024;37;WA;This pizza place is one of my favorite spots in town, just a 5-minute walk from Pike Place Market. Whenever I'm craving a delicious slice, this place is my go-to. The take-out option is super convenient, and they're always speedy with my order. And let's talk about their Rocco's specialty pizza, it's absolutely delicious and innovative. On my last visit, I ordered the Stacey & Tina's night out, and the crust was the perfect balance between crispy and fluffy, while the sauce tied everything together with its toppings. Plus, the half size is just right for sharing between two people.The atmosphere here is great too. The fun part about this place is that they put the drink menu in a kids' book cover. It's quirky, fun, and totally sets the mood. The staff are friendly, helpful, and attentive. I'll definitely be coming back for more pizzas and to explore their specialty options.
Rocco's;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=40;Antwone C.;5;3/28/2024;38;IL;My wife and I stumbled into Rocco's during a conference trip to Seattle without a reservation, but we lucked out! Despite the Friday night frenzy, we snagged seats at the bar in just 20 minutes. The meatballs were a total game-changer - seriously, they were the highlight of the night. And don't even get me started on the pizza - absolute perfection in every bite. Plus, the ambiance was eclectic and made for a perfect date night vibe. No doubt, next time we hit up Seattle, Rocco's is our first stop!

We started with their Meatballs Al Forno and Brussel Sprouts, followed by two mouth-watering pizzas: ""Three Little Piggies"" and ""Stacey and Tina's Night Out."" The meatballs, with their spicy kick, was a highlight for me, adding a zing to our meal.Both pizzas were delicious, but next time, I'll try and request larger slices to enjoy them NY-style. That minor point aside, everything about our visit was top-notch. Our server deserves a special mention for their quick, attentive, and friendly service, enhancing our overall experience. The decor and ambiance stood out, the place also felt so much larger inside than I expected. Great place for any get together, hanging out with friends, or a date night.Highly recommend for anyone looking for an outstanding dining experience in Seattle!"

Pizza was delicious- veggie, pepperoni and meat slice. I would recommend all of them. All of the salads look great but the arugula one was bomb. Tequila cocktails were a touch bland and not spicy like their menu description. The bar is fully stocked with tons of options though, great selection. Waiter was nice. I would def come back.

We ordered 3 half pies Three Little Piggies, Sally and Tina's Night Out(I think, can't remember exactly), and a classic Pepperoni. The food was excellent super tasty, but especially the Sally and Tina's Night Out it was so flavorful, but the crust on it had absorbed all that good flavor. Definitely eat there again when I go to Seattle.

There is a tin ceiling which I love and rarely see out here (I'm an East coast transplant), cool booths, and some private tables and window seating. Everything was super unique and you can tell they put some love and thought into this place. I had a slice this afternoon and it was super delish and reasonably priced! Dare I say, I may have found my favorite pizza place in Seattle ;) I will definitely be back!"

Now all they offer is overpriced items served with a thick layer of sass. My breakfast sandwich today was stone cold on the inside and VERY not worth $10 and the coffee was ""meh"""

Cafe Hagen;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/caf%C3%A9-hagen-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Jen L.;2;01-02-2024;12;WA;"I always love visiting Cafe Hagen on my weekends for a morning coffee or brunch with friends. The decor is a perfect mix of dark minimalist and modern, with greenery sprinkled all across the cafe to make it feel cozy. The line to wait for coffee is always pretty long on weekend mornings between 10am to noon and extends to the outside patio, so be prepared to wait if you're planning on going around that time; or bring a friend to help make the time go by faster. I do wish there was more seating at this cafe, especially in the winter when outdoor seating is limited. Trying to snag a seat is always a difficult task here.The menu at Cafe Hagen is just as eclectic as the decor. I was impressed with the range of offerings, from classic breakfast items like pancakes and eggs to more adventurous options like the avocado toast with smoked salmon. I opted for the latter, and it was absolutely delicious. The combination of flavors was unexpected but worked so well together. The staff is not particularly friendly compared to most local coffee shops, so don't be offended if they're a bit curt or try to rush you. Beyond that, Cafe Hagen is the kind of place where you can go to work or study, catch up with friends, or just sit and people-watch.The pastries at Cafe Hagen are always a favorite. They are truly works of art, with intricate designs and flavors that will leave you in awe. I especially love their pear danish and seed snapper. Overall, I recommend Cafe Hagen to anyone looking for a one-of-a-kind cafe experience. It's a great post-workout coffee spot or a place to get work done and catch up with friends."

The highlight of my visit was the waffles with fresh fruits - they were delicious and had the perfect balance of sweetness and freshness.But that's not all - the rosemary latte was also a standout item on the menu. The fragrant aroma of rosemary perfectly complemented the rich espresso, making for a truly unique and enjoyable coffee experience.The only downside was that the cafe was quite crowded, especially during the cold weather. However, the cozy atmosphere and friendly service more than made up for it. Plus, the bustling vibe added to the excitement and energy of the place.Overall, I highly recommend Cafe Hagen to anyone looking for a great breakfast or brunch spot in South Lake Union.

They make a fresh and delish avocado toast. I'm pretty much addicted to the seed snapper pastry too (which has a scandinavian name i won't attempt to recreate). Always friendly and top notch service, interesting drinks and has a nice ambience with the high ceilings and live plants. this place is right by my apt and makes me feel at home.

Great specialty coffee, be sure to get a bag or two to take home. Pastries are all fresh-baked as well. I always get the avo toast or breakfast bun, both are amazing. Brunch can be a bit crazy on the weekends but is always worth the wait!

Yummy food - the menu is in flux, but they said it's all made in-house, so miles better than mass-produced Starbucks pastries. Outstanding coffee - it's on the lighter side and sweeter side, but their espresso is so tasty it's surprising they're not blowing up the coffee scene. Great vibe - yes the music can get loud, but you cannot beat those big windows and all the plants and clean design.

Homer;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/homer-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Rodney X B.;1;10/18/2019;2;WA;The wait at this place is outrageous. They put you on a list then call on you for your table to be ready and you get there and it's not ready. Their servers and hosts act like we don't exist and ignores us and tests our patience. This place is riddled with white people of priveledge. Way to make you feel inclusive. I would not recomend this place ever again.
Homer;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/homer-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Amy N.;2;2/16/2020;7;WA;The host failed to tell us when we put our name in that we had 5 minutes to get back once we received a text. When we arrived after 7 minutes we were told we were too late and 3 tables that had been texted in that 2 minute period walked in after us and got seated before us. We were now looking at a 20 minute wait. Host fail. Set expectations appropriately moving forward for a better overall experience for your customers.
Homer;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/homer-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Diane J.;4;11-02-2023;29;WA;This restaurant is ideally in between casual and fine dining. The dishes come in small portions for sharing and all the food that we tried was absolutely delicious. A must try hidden Seattle spot. Beginning with the neighborhood it was located in, the local, home like vibe, we felt invited and welcomed. We opted to dine at a table to get the full experience. Service was excellent and friendly.They have a good variety of options to share. The food is Mediterranean inspired. Ordered hummus plate, apple salad, meatballs, lamb ribs and basmati cake. Each savory dish's flavors played off of each other so perfectly.There are plenty of vegetarian options. If you are visiting for the first time, do take the kitchen counter seat. You'll have a nice view of how the food was made.
Homer;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/homer-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Harley H.;4;10/17/2020;9;WA;Tried Homer at the start of quarantine and had an AMAZING experience. Seriously some of the best food I'd had in a while. I'm taking a star off because they changed the menu and don't have many vegetarian options and no lamb pita that I loved. I will be back and I'm excited to try more dishes once the menu is expanded but it seems a tad limited now which is understandable.
Homer;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/homer-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Susan S.;4;11/26/2018;6;WA;New restaurant around the neighborhood, my first experience there wasn't too bad. I hope they will keep it up.
Homer;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/homer-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Matthew M.;5;8/17/2024;39;CA;Last night, we had the pleasure of dining at Restaurant Homer in Seattle, and it was an experience that exceeded every expectation. From start to finish, each dish was a masterclass in flavor, texture, and presentation.We began with the hummus, a deceptively simple starter that showcased the depth of flavor achieved by the combination of chickpeas and cumin. The hummus was creamy, rich, and perfectly balanced with just the right amount of spice, setting the tone for the evening.For our larger plates, we indulged in the grilled pork with caramelized cashew, cherry mostarda, fennel, and dandelion. The pork was tender and succulent, with the cherry mostarda adding a sweet-tart contrast that elevated the dish to new heights. The caramelized cashew provided a delightful crunch, while the fennel and dandelion brought freshness and complexity to the plate. The wahl grazing lamb was equally impressive, paired with smoked tomato kibbeh naya, sungolds, nectarines, and mustard seeds. The lamb was cooked to perfection, and the accompaniments created a symphony of flavors that danced on the palate.We complemented these larger plates with two smaller but equally memorable dishes. The smoked potatoes with Tunisian pepper jam, anise seeds, and walnut emulsion were a standout, offering a smoky richness that was beautifully countered by the spicy-sweet jam and nutty walnut. The grilled summer squash was another revelation, served with corn custard, pickled grapes, crunchy sesame, and basil. Each bite was a harmonious blend of sweet, tangy, and savory, with the pickled grapes adding an unexpected yet delightful zing.To finish, we indulged in the burnt cheesecake with rhubarb compote and black lime, paired with hibiscus ice cream. The cheesecake was the perfect balance of creamy and slightly tart, with the rhubarb compote adding a fruity brightness. The hibiscus ice cream was a refreshing and floral end to the meal, tying everything together beautifully.Overall, our dinner at Homer was nothing short of extraordinary. Every dish was thoughtfully crafted, with each ingredient playing its part in a perfectly orchestrated dining experience. I can't recommend Homer enough--it's a true gem in Seattle's culinary scene.

Niku Niku Japanese Barbecue;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/niku-niku-japanese-barbecue-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Tung T.;2;02-01-2025;20;WA;"I keep coming here because it's the closest Japanese BBQ spot, but every time I leave, I tell myself I should have just gone to Ishoni in Capitol Hill instead.When this place first opened, it was actually really good. But ever since they switched to an all-you-can-eat model, it's gone downhill. The restaurant itself is sleek, modern, and has a nice ambiance--great lighting, stylish decor, and an overall upscale feel. It's a spot that looks like it should offer a high-quality dining experience. Unfortunately, the food and service don't quite match the setting.The biggest issue is the two-tier AYCE menu. Every time I visit, most of the premium items on the top tier are ""out of stock,"" making the upgrade feel like a waste of money. The 90-minute limit wouldn't be a problem if you could actually order what you wanted, but with so many unavailable items, it just feels frustrating.While the atmosphere is enjoyable, the inconsistency in food quality and availability make it hard to justify coming back. At this point, it's just not worth it when there are better options elsewhere."

Niku Niku Japanese Barbecue;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/niku-niku-japanese-barbecue-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Veronica L.;4;11-01-2024;67;WA;I recently visited this AYCE Korean BBQ spot priced at around $35-40 per person. While it's a decent deal for AYCE, the meat selection is fairly limited. The regular cuts, while satisfactory, are often quite chewy, so if you're looking for higher quality, the upgrade option is definitely the way to go. That said, even the upgraded meats are just okay--they don't quite stand out compared to other places in this price range. Nice open place with good hood system so it doesn't feel too smoky.I miss the old Niku, where you could order a la carte with better quality meats and more personalized service. Now, it feels more like any other AYCE KBBQ place, which has its appeal for the price, but lacks the uniqueness and service it once had. Overall, it's a fair value if you're craving AYCE KBBQ on a budget, but it doesn't offer the standout experience it used to.

Regrettably, I had to discard both of the brisket wonton soups I ordered due to their unpleasant odor and taste. The smell was so strong it permeated my entire house.Given my high expectations for great wonton soup, this was quite disappointing. Either the preparation of this soup differed greatly from what I'm accustomed to, or it was spoiled in some way.

We got also a pork dish, same here, easy on the meat with a boatload of rice, great flavor. Water seems to be unfiltered, with some chlorine flavor.

The beef brisket, in particular, was a standout--tender, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. Each bowl of noodle soup was rich and satisfying, with a perfect balance of textures and flavors. The Chinese Donuts, while not crispy on the outside as I had hoped, still tasted good and was a great addition to our soups. The Chinese Broccoli was cooked perfectly, but it was dressed with a bit too much oyster sauce, making it a bit overly salty.Service was friendly and fast, adding to the overall great experience.

Be prepared for a bit of a wait though, because it's so popular. The restaurant itself isn't huge, and the tables are cozy-close, adding to its charm.The food it's absolutely fantastic! I ordered both the No.17 Squid Ball & beef brisket noodle soup and the No.9 Wonton & beef brisket noodle soup. Both dishes were amazing, just depending on your topping preference. Personally, I'd highly recommend giving the wonton a try; the filling is incredibly flavorful and just the right size. And another highlight is their Chinese donut - it's a delightful match with soy milk!If you're craving some comforting Cantonese food, this spot is a must-visit.

Mike's Noodle House;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/mikes-noodle-house-seattle?not_recommended_start=40;Raymond W.;5;1/21/2014;50;NY;"We stumbled across this hidden gem on our family vacation to the PNW. Our plan to explore the ID has led us to a parking spot just outside of Mike's. My mom stepped outside of the car, she immediately started sniffing the air like a wolf in the frozen forest and pointed to the door...""We must go in!"". The aroma being described is the distinctive smell of yellow chives mixed with chicken broth. A smell commonly found near wonton noodle shops in Hong Kong, but it was a smell no where to be found on the east coast. It was 3 pm, the place was fairly empty, and I had my doubts.  My mom went ahead and ordered the wonton noodle soup, and a congee. My sister had a mixture of wonton and dumplings, and I had the beef brisket noodles. This was just 2 hours after stuffing ourselves at Pike Place Market. The moment my mom took her first bite, I can see her smile from ear to ear. I then had a taste of the wonton and I understood why. The wonton were made true to HK style with fresh shrimp and a bit of pork, unlike other noodles shops where the pork plays more of a dominant role. More importantly, the folks at Mike's really took the time to create the perfect broth. When I looked through the glass window to the kitchen, there were chicken bones piled high to the ceiling, all were purely used to create the broth alone. It was the best bowl of wonton noodle soup I've ever had in the US, and in fact outside of Hong Kong. We stopped by Mike's one more time on the day of our departure before heading back to the east coast.I recently visited Seattle again for a weekend in October, and I ended up eating at this place twice on my trip. This time around, I went at lunch time, there was actually a line waiting to get in. I took my korean friends whom lived in Seattle for the past 10 years to Mike's and they were surprised how they have never heard of this place before, but I think they are hooked now. If you love noodle soups and know what a bowl of true HK-style wonton noodle soup should taste like, you must stop try Mike's."

Harbor City Restaurant;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Chris P.;1;12/29/2016;7;WA;"The worst chinese food I have ever had. I ordered for delivery. I ordered 4 dishes most of which had green or white onions in huge chunks that were barely even cooked. The green onions were literally cut into 3"" chunks. They were very nearly raw. The broccoli beef had chinese broccoli not regular broccoli which I had never seen for that dish, and the menu didn't state that it was made with chinese broccoli. The bok choy with garlic sauce had plenty of bok choy....but mostly the white bitter part and very few greens. The beef was tough and chewy not tender like it should be and flavorless. The mongolian beef was sweet which it isnt supposed to be and minty which is just weird. The fried rice was mushy. Seriously just crap food. I didnt even finish it. Just tossed the rest. It seems that the in house eating is great according to the reviews so I'm really puzzled why delivery was so bad. But for some reason, delivery food quality in this case was ridiculously bad. Who ever made this wasn't even pretending to know how to use a wok. I ordered this through amazon restaurants. I'll be contacting them about a refund. Yeah, it was THAT bad."
Harbor City Restaurant;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=0;Mitch K.;1;06-08-2016;29;WA;Had my order delivered through Amazon Prime Now, used their $10 off first time order coupon code. Delivery time was 39 minutes, which was awesome.  The Shrimp and Vegetable Egg Rolls were awesome, packed full of tender shrimp. The Potstickers were large, and the filling, though unidentifiable, tasted pretty good. The Almond Fried Chicken was overcooked, chewy, and tough. The sauce was not a normal thick sauce for Almond Fried Chicken... not sure what it was. But the chicken tasted OLD, and was inedible. I won't even take it home to try to feed it to my cats, it's THAT bad. Since Almond Fried Chicken is the ONLY main dish I ever order from a Chinese/Cantonese restaurant, I will most likely never order from Harbor City Restaurant again... there was really no excuse for sending out such bad chicken to a delivery customer. Ten bucks down the drain on that one!

The pork buns were the worst I've ever had and the har gow (normally my gf's favorite) was her least favorite thing we ordered.

Everything we ordered was good. Not too greasy and salty. My ultimate favorite is the raw fish salad. So much happening in my mouth with so many flavors coming out. Packed full of flavor and textures. For an Irish guy Im happy.

While Jade Garden is a consistent favorite, this little younger sister across the street has become a crowd pleaser in recent years.

Harbor City Restaurant;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=30;Pam X.;4;12-03-2018;4;WA;Harbor City is a staple in Seattle's Chinatown. It opens early and stays open late. I decided to review Harbor City because early mornings in Seattle's Chinatown can be difficult to find good Chinese food. Harbor City offers Dim Sum each day so one can always go here. But the good thing about Harbor City is you can order off the menu as well as select Dim Sum from the carts. I like to order one or two vegetables from the menu to complement the Dim Sum. The two I like to order are Chinese Broccoli and Bok Choy. Of course this is a lot of food so going as a group of four or more is best.I had 4 friends from Spokane, WA in town and took them to Harbor City. Not having good quality Chinese in Spokane, they really had a good time. I got funny looks when order vegetables, but in no time both dishes were gone. Between the Dim Sum and Vegetables, everyone had a good experience. The food as usual is always good.
Harbor City Restaurant;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=30;Jessica P.;4;11/30/2018;1;CA;We were on vacation with my family and definitely hungry looking for a great place to indulge. This certainly hit the spot. Delicious dimsum choices, menus made to order esp the peking pork chop. A must try.
Harbor City Restaurant;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=40;Luke N.;4;1/16/2018;10;WA;I love trying out new restaurants, and it was a fun place for my friends and I to go. We enjoyed the food very much. I loved the combination of traditional Korean flavors with a modern twist - unique!It was sort of 'Korean tapas', but it was a bit expensive for the amount of food you get. So tasty though! The service was good and everyone was friendly, so no complaints there.I know they're new, but I do wish they had a happy hour. I work downtown, and would love to come by more frequently, but unless a happy hour appears, this place will be for special evenings.
Harbor City Restaurant;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=40;Francis K.;4;9/29/2017;16;WA;Very good. Waitress misunderstood and place the wrong order for me.
Harbor City Restaurant;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=40;Roy F.;4;2/20/2017;10;WA;"I had a brunch here on Saturday with my friends. My friends were telling me before that this was the best place to have Dim Sum in town, and my expectation was set very high. When we got there around 11:30, it was already fully packed. ""shumai"" was really good, and also I liked stir fried Chinese broccoli. To be frank, food itself is maybe 3.5 stars but including serving speed and ""price"", I would say 4 stars. To me, it is nonsense to expect ""great five star"" service from $ or $$ restaurants. If someone wants to get Five-star service, they should go ""high price"" restaurants. From their price, I think 4 - 4.5 starts should be reasonable with me. Again, it is a great place to enjoy dim sum and also ""China town""! You must expect long wait if you go for brunch."
Harbor City Restaurant;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=40;Dennis M.;4;12-06-2016;446;NJ;Yummy. It's the real deal
Harbor City Restaurant;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=40;Nathan J.;4;7/23/2016;5;WA;The kung pao chicken was very good, not too spicy or salty. The onion ginger chicken was also very tasty. Chicken very tender and good portions. Chinese broccoli was very good as was the soft tofu and mushroom and the charsiu bbq honey chicken was good. The only thing that lacked was the taro beef dim sum. Not much flavor or taro color! Service is as expected for only one guy serving the whole restaurant, but our food was delivered quickly. I would order their normal food but stay away from the dim sum.

Carts & Trays of wonderful dumplings come around quite often.

Not great, but not terrible. The trick though, is learning some of the secret dishes this place has to offer: Try ordering a ""century egg steamed fish rice-noodle roll"" (or ""pay dan yu pien cheung fun"" in Cantonese), or a ""spareribs and chicken feet steamed rice-noodle roll"" (""pai gwut fong jow cheung fun""). I promise these will blow you away. One of the best kept secrets in Chinatown."

Harbor City Restaurant;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=90;Peter C.;5;05-02-2013;23;WI;For dim sum, I've tried Jade Garden, House of Hong, and a few others in addition to Harbor City. I see the same dishes at most places, but there are certainly differences in preparation, quality and freshness. Harbor City is the best. Their shrimp cakes in particular are excellent. Many dishes, like the pork bun, seem to have a glaze of honey or syrup on them and are sweeter than at most places. The staff are good about filling water glasses and are very willing to make things upon request (my daughter loves pork pot stickers, which aren't usually on the carts). The restaurant is small and gets crowded on Sunday mornings.

Their portions are ample, the variety and preparation of the items excellent, the staff attentive. The prices are also very reasonable, you'll be pleasently surprised when you receive the bill.A Wide selections of teas are available to those who ask. My favorite item is the Lo Mai Gai, but the Taro nest is better than I've had at other local Dim Sum restaurants."
