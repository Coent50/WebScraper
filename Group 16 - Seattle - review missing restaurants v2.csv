Daniel's Broiler,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/daniels-broiler-seattle-7?not_recommended_start=0,Colin B.,1.0,8/10/2018,7,AZ,How can you possible justify a $65 dollar strip steak? I assume you're paying for the location rather than the food. Typical for a fame hungry business; ramp the price up for the location while serving unimpressive food. I could make the same meal for $25. I'm willing to pay for service buy you're being ridiculous.

I've worked in restaurants for years and know what good service is. after we were sat the waiter promptly took our drink orders before we could even take a look at the menu. interesting fact, the steaks here a way overpriced. i order the filet, and obviously at these prices i was expecting perfection. instead i got inspection, the steak appeared to be raw so i kindly notified the waiter that i would appreciate a few more min on the grill. when they brought it back to me 10 min later, it was medium well, i ordered medium rare. not to mention the sear on the steak was pathetic. I've been cooking all my life and I could have done better with a filet purchased from Wal-Mart! i was too upset to complain about my meal so i just bit the bullet of a steak and tried to enjoy the remainder of the evening. the service was good but i felt a bit of animosity from the waiter. not sure if ill be coming back here, It' s hard to recommend. el gaucho on the other hand...that's a different story.Ian W."

I doubt I'll be back as there are many fine dinning establishments in Seattle who still give you a choice in the amount you tip."

Two times with groups of about 10 and once with a date. The group things seem to put the staff in a bad way. One time we had extra drinks on our bill (The drinks we ordered from the bar due to not wanting to keep waiting forever for our waiter to take our order were paid for at the bar AND put on our receipt) including a bottle of wine we didn't order, a pile of plates were dropped, we literally did not get asked what choice of side we wanted until one of the people in our party asked the waiter if they wanted to know what we wanted, my steak (medium well) also was literally charred on both sides that the meat on the inside was only about 1/4 inch thick. I get that bigger groups are more difficult and things like dropping plates is just something that is going to happen but if you can't provide excellent service at this price point you need to stay within your abilities. My date experience was better but there's plenty of nice places at this price point that can really ""Wow"" you."

We visited for a New Year's Eve dinner and everything was going well--until just before midnight. Two minutes before the countdown, we received our dessert and asked if we could step outside to watch the fireworks. The staff asked us to leave our card as a precaution due to previous walkouts, which we did. However, when the fireworks ended, we found the doors locked and struggled to get back inside. To make matters worse, the waitress had already packed up our desserts and removed my glass of wine. This was not how I wanted to start the new year! The manager eventually offered to have our desserts remade at the table, but by that point, the damage was done. The experience left us all with a bitter taste.

My companion opted for the classic turkey, while I leaned towards the prime rib. The gustatory experience was undeniably praiseworthy, with flavors that underscored a notable culinary finesse.Service, operating within the parameters of adequacy, maintained an understated demeanor, providing a seamless backdrop to our dining experience.However, the post-dinner endeavor to secure leftovers took an unforeseen turn. A meticulous separation of meat and fat, coupled with a modest request for an extra serving of potatoes, aimed to prolong the culinary pleasure. Regrettably, upon revisiting the remains, the gastronomic continuity suffered a setback. The boxed ensemble, lacking cranberry sauce, horseradish that had been left on my plate, and the absent side of coveted potatoes I requested, presented a major Thanksgiving leftovers letdown---especially taking into consideration the high price we had paid for the meal. Nevertheless, let this culinary service anomaly not overshadow the overall commendable nature of the experience. As we contemplate future visits, a pragmatic approach emerges - a proactive request during the boxing process to ensure a more faithful representation of the intended leftovers. Here's to culinary precision and anticipating an untarnished encore in subsequent engagements."

Terrible food. To New Yorkers: Would you eat anywhere in Times Squares to line up for a nasty piece of pastry? No, we wouldn't. We would go to Ladur�e or Magnolia's.

I used Banner Banks smartphone app (official Banner Bank App promoted by bank) to make a deposit as I was leaving for vacation. I had used this process a couple of times before with no problem. This was used to move money from one of my bank account to another (available funds was never stated as a problem). The app involves submitting a photo of both the front and back of the check. When submitting the deposit the app show ""submitted"" as status. After reviewing, the app status gets changed to ""accepted"". I verified that the status was ""Accepted"" before leaving data coverage. When I returned on 7/19/2014, the status still showed ""accepted"" but the transaction was never processed. This resulted in overdraft fees of $120 plus the fees applied by the other banks that were declined. On 7/21/2014 I went to the branch to see what had happened. They said that they had questions about the check and had declined to process it. The teller told me that she didn't care what the app said, it didn't process and they weren't going to back off any charges. When I asked to speak to the manager I was asked to be seated. then a couple of minutes later the teller came back out and said that the manager ""reviewed the case"" and that they wouldn't make any changes. When asked if I could talk to her, I was told NO. When I returned home, I contacted the corporate office and was told it was up to the local branch manager. I did get a phone number for a regional supervisor (Marcello (425) 739-1055), but he seams to not want to answer his phone."

The food itself was just okay; while the Classic Smoked Salmon had a decent flavor, it didn't quite stand out as exceptional. The BBQ Pork was similarly average. Overall, it's a convenient spot for a quick bite, especially if you're already in the area, but the taste and value didn't quite match the hype for me."

Their food is pretty good... ask them for their most famous piroshky and you'll be happy. You can't actually sit down and eat so you're going to be dealing with a hit and run scenario. To me, a 5-star rating consists of AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE, AMAZING FOOD, AND AMAZING AMBIANCE and here you just get good food."

This small, bustling bakery offers an incredible selection of hand-held pastries that are as delicious as they are iconic.I tried the Smoked Salmon Pate Piroshky, and it was everything I hoped for and more. The pastry itself was flaky, golden, and baked to perfection, while the filling was rich, flavorful, and packed with high-quality smoked salmon. The balance of buttery dough and savory filling made every bite unforgettable.Be prepared for a line--it's a testament to how beloved this spot is. But trust me, the wait is worth it. The staff works quickly and efficiently, and the pastries are always fresh out of the oven.Whether you're grabbing a quick bite while exploring Pike Place or looking for a unique Seattle treat to take home, Piroshky Piroshky delivers an authentic and satisfying experience."

They almost always have a line down the block. Just like Starbucks.  Do not fear the wait times though for Piroshky!!! The lines go very quickly and all food is made from scratch and very fresh!!!4/5 s for atmosphere because it is neat they have windows where you can see into the kitchen and watch them make everything and bake , but they do not have tables or chairs available!!We tried a savory and sweet piroshky! The savory was the salmon pate, which I felt was very fitting since we were visiting the fish market . It was smoked salmon and very creamy--absolutely delicious. The sweet was the Moscow roll. Another delicious choice 4/5 s for service. It is counter service and very quick paced. Not much time for friendly conversation, definitely not rude or bad, just too quick for much.A must try when you are visiting Pike Place Market and I rate it as a must try when in Seattle Peep the food pics there are yummy sights to see!"

Worth one visit, or if you have a favorite pastry here then it's worth a stop if you're in the area, but that's kind of it. I don't understand the super long lines and I definitely wouldn't stand in the cold for it. Sounds harsh, but this place gets so much hype and yes it's good, but the hype doesn't match the product in my opinion. Again, worth one visit, but not my favorite.My only favorite thing to get here is the pastry with the spicy cheese sausage in it. If anything, it speaks volumes on how good the sausage is, not the actual breading around it. It's the only thing I will buy here moving forward. Otherwise, workers here are very friendly and patient, they provide a very comfortable vibe and they are just so nice."

These piroshkies are a little different then what you would find in a typical Russian or Eastern European bakery. The dough is puff pastry instead of baked/fried bread. Reminds me of a fancy empanada or handpie. I had the beef and onion. Based on appearances, I was expecting it to sit like a brick in my stomach but the pastry was surprisingly light with a good beef flavor and nicely seasoned not overly salty. Wish I had more time and the stomach space to sample their other offerings."

This was actually my friends and I's FIRST stop in Seattle. We were hungry and we looked at my Seattle ""to do"" list and bam, there it was. Right in front of our eyes. We waited in the line outside with our luggage because we came straight from the airport. The line did go pretty quickly. Do you know what a piroshky is? If not, compare it to a pierogi or a kolachi. Basically bread with stuff .. stuffed inside lol. Carb heaven I must say. Everything has bread with it. Therefore, if you cannot eat carbs or it's a weakness for you, stay away lol. I ended up getting the Smoked Salmon Pate. Giving the traditional Piroshky a local spin, this bestseller is a delicious blend of Smoked Salmon, cream cheese, a dash of dill and onion. I really loved it. It was nice and warm and the smoked salmon was flavorful.Then during a food tour, I had the Smoked Salmon Pate and then an Apple Cinnamon Roll. This includes slices of Granny Smith Apples dusted with Cinnamon, rolled into dough and finished with a glaze of honey and lemon. It is their bestselling sweet creation. It was really good.The morning we had to run to the airport, we ended up coming back. I had the Spinach, Egg, and Cheese. It contained Spinach tossed with Parmesan then baked with egg. This squared pied is topped of a sprinkle of Columbia Valley Sharp Cheddar. Overall, it was a great experience. A little of the expensive side for a pastry. However, it's a ""must go"" for Seattle!

There was a very long wait when I went and it was a week day so I'd recommend going early if you don't want to wait in line.

They're all pretty good, but my go-to is the beef and cheese. A close runner up is the potato and onion. The sweet ones are really good too. The bread is so flaky and warm. If you're ever in Pike Place Market, I would definitely recommend you check them out. The line can get long, but it's worth it. Best to go during the week."

I got a piroshky for the first time and it was delicious. I got the turkey and cheddar one and I would definitely recommend. It's always fun to try some food from different countries when you are just in downtown Seattle!
Piroshky Piroshky,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/piroshky-piroshky-seattle?not_recommended_start=180,Nicholas T.,4.0,6/1/2016,5,WA,I once dated a Russian / Armenian girl whos grandmother introduced me to the Piroshky (what a fun word by the way!)So after finding other spots through yelp I decided to give this one a go and look this place up... pretty glad that I did. Was not dissapointed one bit. I had never though salmon would go well in a piroshky but oh boy was I impressed. I want to go back and try them all. All the food is made fresh daily and it showsYou can taste the freshness in all of the food. I would consider this comfort food and again not sure if it is really healthy although my ex's g-ma used to say it was... Or maybe she wanted me to put those extra pounds on haha

They offer both sweet and savory options, but I tried savory options both times. Their signature item is a smoked salmon pate piroshky... I had someone explain it to me as a somewhat healthy Hot Pocket, and it is very similar! I thoroughly enjoyed the dill flavor in the crust, and the smoked salmon on the inside was fresh, it felt like it had just come out of the oven! I also tried the smoked mozzerella, mushroom, and broccoli and that tasted more like a calzone to me, but still equally as great! The only downside is that this seems to be one of the most popular places in the market and there is often a long line. Be prepared to wait about 15 minutes. It is worth the wait though, I can't wait to come back and try more of their flavors!"

I literally have nothing bad to say relating to this area; the piroshky is consistently fresh and the staff is consistently friendly. I have not attempted all of the many distinct flavors of piroshky, but the ones I 've had (which contain the steak and cheese, rhubarb, cinnamon and cardomon braid, cranberry apple, and basic steak) are amazing! They do not constantly have borscht, but when they do it's also excellent and I highly recommend it."

This small hole in the wall definitely lives up to the concept of a double banquet! Situated on exactly the same side of the road as the first Starbucks across from Pike's Place Market, Piroshky Piroshky serves up pastries filled with either salty or sweet ingredients. My favorites include the Apple Cinnamon Roll as well as the Cheese Onion Garlic Roll. They're REALLY SO great!!!"

They have legs from here to forever. That and the baked goods will drive a simple man insane. The Pumpkin Cinnamon Roll was to die for and the smoked salmon was exceptionally fresh. They must have connection with the mob or something to make sure they have first choice at the freshest ingredients. At times it was unbelievable except for the beef and cheese piroshky. You might like beef and cheese more than I do but I guess I grew up with a bit of Jew in me because I don't like how those ingredients mix. Go there and try everything and then pick your favorite to share with your friends. This is the place that adds a bit of class to the city."

The first time I had it was at the Bumbershoot festival last year. It was freshly made, and the guy gave it to me right out of the fryer. I had the salmon piroshky, shaped like a fish (uber cute). It was sooo good, I went back for another one. Some time later, I was craving another one, so I went by the shop in Pike's Market. It just wasn't the same. sad face. It was still good, but just didn't taste as fresh? I got the same salmon one, but the fish seemed a bit dried out and wasn't as creamy as the one i had at the festival. Still, piroshky is good and yes i will go again, but I still miss my kolaches.."

This charming bakery is known for its diverse and flavorful piroshkies, and it certainly lives up to its reputation.My personal favorite was the cheese and meat piroshky - a warm, hearty parcel filled with aromatic spices. It was the perfect way to kick-start our day of exploration. The taste still lingers in my memory, making me crave another bite.Another standout item was the Vatrushka, a house specialty. This delectable treat consists of house-made dough topped with marionberries & sweet cream cheese, all dusted with powdered sugar. It was sweet without being cloying, and the marionberries added a delightful tanginess that played off the creamy cheese perfectly.Don't let the line intimidate you - Piroshky Piroshky is more than worth the wait.

Amazing prices, out of this country taste! Salmon piroshky the best). It is worth driving across town for, however, parking is sparse which is surprising because it's located inside pike place mnarket.

Soooooo like any responsible person, I came back later.Upon return, the line was all gone! We walked right up and ordered a salmon something, something salmon and delicious. We only bought one, and we loved it. This is definitely worth the stop. It's nestled among many other places that suck tourists in, but this one is the truth. It's worth the stop.It's located right across from the public market; you can't miss it. Look for the line--and get there early! ;-D"

I didn't know what it yet was but I had to have it! I got in line and saw the different kinds of pastries and knew this was going to be an awesome place to snack! The bread not only smells good but tastes amazing! The light crispness and softness of the bread just filled me with joy when taking that first bite. From the freshness to the flavor, I felt I was in heaven. Living in California we definitely have good bakeries but this place is definitely unique to the flavor. So wishing there was one here!"

These things are amazing and there are so many options. I will count down the clock with my work mates to run down and grab one and sit and chat with while grubbing. I love the beef and cheese.

If I'm looking for something savory, I always grab the Smoked Salmon Pate Piroshky but if I have a sweet tooth that day, the Moscow Roll hits the spot. The location is nice as I can grab a pastry then stroll the stalls at Pike Place Market."

Piroshky, Piorshky, you are a delightful, savory, devil that will haunt my food dreams. I stuck to the savory items, and although I can't recall the actual name, my favorite was one that had about a bazillion diced up mushrooms in it. I had two, although I wish I had, had the balls to order 4 and let the world judge me how they saw fit. There were some sweet options as well--- one looked like a death star, I abstained given my preference to gorge myself on savory, but it looked great. Also, a fun line to wait in. Part of the experience right?!"

We tried the potato and mushroom, and a chocolate and hazelnut piroshky. Both were delicious, but the potato and mushroom one was particularly flavorful and tasty. The atmosphere was good too. It's cramped and loud in the small shop (in a good way), and was cozy and very enjoyable. Also, the service was super fast and very friendly."

This is my last day in Seattle and work is carrying me off again. I wanted to leave with a belly full of delicious food and I knew this had to be the place. The crust is perfectly flaky and they are filled to bust. My favorites have to be the beef and onion, the cabbage and onion, and the beef and cheese. The cherry chocolate is always the perfect end. Sometimes the lines are long, *usually* but sometimes if you hit it at the right time, you'll be in and out. Don't let the lines discourage you, it's worth the wait (most good food is). I will certainly miss you and I hope my journey across the country brings me back here again one day."

If you like a YUM piroshky, you must try. If you don't know what a piroshky is, you must try. Try to plan your visit away from popular eating times, as the line outside the place will be long. You won't be disappointed in the place.I didn't know what a piroshky was until I was at a Seafair party 10+ years ago. That's when JEN COLLINS made some for the party and I became a major fan of piroshkies. Jen passed away a few years ago. When I come to PP I think of JEN. This review is dedicated to JEN."

Definitely doesn't disappoint! The treats we bought the first day were so great, we came 2 days in a row. First day we lucked out in the afternoon with no line. Next day, we went to get coffee at the first Starbucks in the world next door and got caught up in the morning rush in a 20 minute Piroshky line. My favorite was the salmon pate, a fish shaped pastry filled with tasty salmon pate; it was a first for me, and quite satisfying. I also tried the beef and cheese, ham, cheese, and spinach, smoked mozzarella, mushroom, and broccoli, and apple cinnamon roll, all recommended by other Yelpers, but out of all of them, the salmon pate was in my opinion the most flavorful and suited to my taste. Though the other pastries didn't become my favorite, they were all worth a try. You'll experience various pastry textures and consistencies;"

If you have never had a piroshok (I think they are called?) then you are in for a treat like I was. Basically they are mini pies with ingredients like meat, veggies, and other things inside. They are flakey and crunchy and filled with all sorts of things. My recommendation is the mushroom, chicken, and rice, the flavors mixed so well with the bread. Also the cranberry apple piroshki were a great dessert, although I guess they are technically not a desert.The bottom line is go here, eat, and you will enjoy."

Everytime I go I pick a sweet and a savory one. I know, I know, serious artery blocker. My favorite is still the smoked salmon piroshky. I usually end up at the Market and just follow the smell. Seriously, a classic. Always great."
Piroshky Piroshky,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/piroshky-piroshky-seattle?not_recommended_start=880,Mary S.,5.0,7/14/2013,4,WA,"Very very busy, but for good reason. The piroshky have amazing crusts, and then filled with flavors such as salmon, broccoli cheese, and cream of mushroom, and sweet Piroshky such as rhubarb and chocolate. There seem to be different types of crust for different types of fillings. I find two savory and one sweet piroshky splits well between 2 people.You will need to stand in line, or go on a slow day (some weekday during the winter when the skies are dark). Then, there is not seating, so you will have to take your piroshky and flee to somewhere more comfortable. If you explore Pike Place, you will find that there is public seating available, or coffee shops you can occupy. If you go straight back and to the left of the Piroshky place, you can find some small amount of public seating, and if that is full, across the street there is a nice park (although someone tried to sell me drugs last time I went there, which might make tourists more uncomfortable).You might wonder if this hassle is worth it. I would say yes. The closest I've found elsewhere is savory pies, but never of the same quality. They are high quality, quirky, but simple, and very Seattle to me. Besides, sometimes standing in line with a bunch of other people excited to experience a place is what you need to convince yourself to pay attention to what you are eating."

For my savory I selected the smoked salmon, broccoli, and mushroom. It was so yummy, I couldn't get enough of it! And then I tried the cherry and white chocolate piroshky, which was so decadently delicious! The people here are so nice. I love this place!"

Try something here. Who doesn't like stuff wrapped in a light flaky dough. The smell of the place was what got me so enticed. The place is a tiny spot in one of the buildings of the market. The wife really liked this place at it reminded her of her grandmothers meat pies as a kid. So we only tried the one beef and onion, but we couldn't be happier. This thing was heavenly. Just one more bite was all I wanted and then when it was all gone, I almost ran back from the hotel to get another one. Will have to try another one before leaving town."

All the more if it's filled with BEEF & CHEESE???? It's impossible! You just can't go wrong!So, we waited in a long line that cleared out fast and the whole time, my mouth was watering looking at their pastries and trying to decide what to get. We tried the Apple Cinnamon Roll, Beef & Cheese, Chocolate Hazelnut roll, and their Potato Mushroom & Onion. Out of the 4, the beef and cheese was the best, BUT everything else was good. It's places like these that make me want to have a second stomach.

I was lucky, there is no long line in the morning and I got a wonderful apple cinnamon piroshky.

Pike's Place itself is an experience, but you never know if tourist spots will have good food. Piroshky's perogies are delish. The line is worth waiting in and moves fast. A perogie is a Russian pie. I had the salmon pate and dill perogie. It was piping hot and flaky, buttery soft. I would order these to have in Texas! For dessert I had an apple cinnamon made with green apples. It was full of big chunks of delicious fresh, apple. It was an affordable lunch for just about $8. Be prepared to eat standing up, unless you can find a bench somewhere around the shops."

Vons did not disappoint. I started with the smoked cherry Manhattan and the salmon chowder. The flavor of the salmon chowder was awesome I thoroughly enjoyed it. The bacon chunks caught me by surprise but overall still a great meal. The cherry Manhattan was a bit too sweet for my liking but luckily for me the Monday special was traditional manhattans, so of course I indulged. The traditional manhattan was a crowd favorite and made with love. Highly recommend this place for drinks, ambience, and food. The service was also excellent."

I had high hopes when I ordered a specialty drink from their menu, with a simple request to substitute Bar Boss vodka for Grey Goose. However, the waiter's response left me baffled as he kept mentioning he would ""add on"" to the drink. Confused but willing to trust his expertise, I let it slide.When our drinks finally arrived, I couldn't help but feel like I was sipping on colored water. It seemed like my custom concoction had gone awry. My husband, who ordered his usual Hendricks gin and tonic, was met with a diluted disappointment. We're no strangers to this drink, and this one was exceptionally watered down. In summary, I would advise you to bypass the drinks altogether at this establishment. While the cocktails may leave much to be desired, the food is an entirely different story. We had the ""bang bang chicken"" and a serving of shredded pork fries, both bursting with flavor. If you're dining here, save your money for the delectable dishes and opt for tap beers or bottled drinks if you're in the mood. Skip the bartender's experiments"

They have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating available.Ordered 6 plates of 4 different types of food items: burrata, hummus, bang bang chicken, chicken wings. The food was quite good. Nothing to die for, but good. Chicken wings could have been better. The drinks were fine as well. Some of them have additional presentation added like a mini firecracker (picture attached).Service was fantastic.

Coming from the place I felt so elated and relaxed, I am surely looking forward to coming back to this place and bring more of my friends to live the experience."

The Classic burger was awesome! Trying to be somewhat ""wholesome"" I asked for no bun and they set it over a fresh green salad...which was AMAZING! I tasted a few of the chips which were some of the finest I Have had in awhile. I saw lots of the pizza's coming out and while dining with my father we understood we should have mixed it up a bit and not gotten the same thing!

The patty was cooked to perfection--juicy, flavorful, and with a slight char that added a smoky depth. The sourdough bun (a signature at Von's) was soft yet sturdy, with a subtle tang that complemented the burger perfectly. The toppings were fresh and well-balanced: crisp lettuce, ripe tomato, melty cheese, and just the right amount of their house-made sauce.I also appreciated the side of hand-cut fries, which were crispy on the outside and fluffy inside--just the way I like them. Paired with one of their craft cocktails, it was an absolutely satisfying meal.The atmosphere added to the experience: casual yet stylish, with great service and a lively vibe.

The flavors were balanced, the quality was superb, and each dish left us wanting just one more bite.From start to finish, the service was top-notch.

The Quatre Viande Pizza boasts an excellent dough with a crunchy yet soft crust and savory toppings balanced by a subtly sweet tomato sauce. The Hass Avocado & Billionaire's Bacon burger is another winner, with juicy beef, flavorful bacon, and avocado that ties everything together perfectly. The Seattle Seafood Stew has a comforting tomato flavor, with flakey cod, well-cooked clams, and fluffy focaccia for dipping, though the stew's overall flavor is somewhat muted. For dessert, the Vanilla Ice Cream, served with a huge sparkler for my birthday, was fresh with a noticeable vanilla bean taste, though a bit icy in texture which I personally enjoyed.The interior is dimly lit and cozy, creating a warm atmosphere.

Wish I tried their original location. Most of their dishes were too salty. My favorite was the nasi lemak, had the right texture, balance in flavor, and nice plating. Would skip the pineapple and cucumber salad, mine had mainly pineapple and just tastes like tajin and fish sauce, can simple make at home. The fried chicken wings were dry and simple, would pass on that as well. Food portions were small for the price.Staff were friendly, checked up on us often and gave good recommendations.

I mean, I've seen some impressive bartenders in my time, but these two take the cake (or should I say, the cocktail)!First off, let's talk about the happy hour - it was like a magical potion of joy and discounted drinks. I don't know how they do it, but Taylor and Erick managed to turn an ordinary evening into a fabulous fiesta! And the drinks? Oh boy, they were so tasty that I almost wanted to order one of each just to taste the rainbow of flavors. I'm pretty sure they secretly sprinkle a little bit of unicorn dust in every glass.Now, let's not forget the atmosphere - it was as lively as a pack of party animals on a Friday night! I don't know if it was Taylor and Erick's magnetic personalities or just the fact that they make drinks that are pure liquid happiness, but the place was buzzing with good vibes.Overall, my experience with Taylor and Erick at Vons 1000 Spirits was nothing short of amazing. They're like the Batman and Robin of bartending - except instead of fighting crime, they're fighting sobriety! If you want a good time, tasty drinks, and an atmosphere that feels like a non-stop party, look no further than these two maestros of mixology. Cheers to Taylor and Erick - you both were absolutely fabulous!!"

I came in just after checking into the hotel around lunch time and was surprised to find a full and bustling bar with the coolest kitchen and tons of cool stuff to look at everywhere! Josh, the host was warm and welcoming handed me menus and pointed me to the bar upon request. I was greeted with a warm friendly smile by Jess the bartender and a personal pitcher of nice cold water without first requesting. I was excited after reading the menu and asked Jess for some recommendations on a house cocktail and some lunch options. She suggested the old fashioned alternative they called ""The Leatherbound,"" and after a lovely rundown of the menu I decided on the Tellicherry Chicken pasta dish, which came out in superhero time. I was blown away with BOTH my drink and my pasta dish. Sabrina, the other bartender, came over to check on me just after my food was delivered- there was absolutely nothing that could have made my lunch any closer to perfection. The atmosphere was rocking throughout the restaurant, everyone was smiling and the service was incredible! I unfortunately had to go off to a work meeting for the rest of the day followed by an early flight home in the morning so I couldn't experience more cocktails and what looks to be a fantastic menu. The only bad part was leaving this little treasure I had just discovered. Thank you for a wonderful, even if brief, experience. I wish there were more establishments just like this one!"

In Seattle it is hard to find a full kitchen available so late in the evening. Katie and Natalie were pleasant at the front desk and even let me sit outside at 10pm! They had a heater and amazing suggestions. Traci was our server and she was training Rebecca. She had awesome banter but also incredible knowledge on the food. We settled on some pastas to share. The king salmon pasta and chicken pasta with pepper. I was so full and happy at the end of my meal. Thanks Vons! We will be back!

As soon as I walked in the door, I was greated by a lovely young host. I think her name was Zia? She took the time to find accommodations for my group. There were 6 of us on a busy Friday night, yet she was able to find us a table almost immediately, to our delight. Our server, Elizabeth, was a wealth of knowledge on their spirit collection ( Yes they really have over 1 thousand) and was able to recommend each of us great drinks to try. Having already been impressed, to food left me speechless. Their ""Mac n 4 cheeses"" was decadent. The perfect amount of rich, not to mention how delicious their house made sourdough pasta is! My wife had Avocado Bacon burger and was equally satisfied. It safe to say me and my family will be back soon!"

Their sourdough pesto pasta was delicious! What I really appreciated was that our server, Traci, took the time to explain all her favorite key dishes to us when we were having difficulty deciding over the incredible menu choices.What really stood out to me as a patron was the care she took with our kids at the table. My daughter loves mac and cheese but there was no option for it on the kids menu. Without hesitation Traci said she could modify a kids pasta to make as mac and cheese. She did give warning that the mac and cheese would be a bit spicy but my daughter was elated at the idea of mac and cheese. Wouldn't you know it, as children do, my daughter changed her mind after one bite. Apologetically I explained the situation to our server when she came to the table after the food was delivered. Traci was more than happy to replace my child's meal with an alternative cream sauce, which my daughter loved, and the new dish was out within minutes of my request. As a parent it is always an adventure to go out with your children because you can never anticipate how long their attention will be kept before they are ALL DONE and want to move on. I was extremely impressed and thankful for the care and understanding our server took to make sure everyone at my table enjoyed their meal. Even though Von's has 1000 spirits and seems to cater to an older crowd I still left feeling it was a family-friendly restaurant as well."

Prompt service and attention to detail was in point. Every 30mins the bar spins a wheel for a discount drink price. Our table had the following: pulled pork Mac and cheese (2 orders), pulled pork fries, salmon pasta, salmon chowder, salmon fish and chips (3 orders), and hamburger. The entire party would come back.

I ate at Bobby Flays restaurant in Vegas as well as had the ""famous"" burger of Gordon Ramsay.. the burger here put both to shame. Best food I have EVER had ( I've eaten around the world, I did not expect to say that about Seattle). The atmosphere was incredible- unique and classy yet edgy, fun and chaotic without being boisterous, a mystery without being complicated. The staff (ask for Gabby!!) was beyond helpful as well as knowledgable, attentive without being annoying; impeccable service. The manager was out and about, the entire place was so genuine it was almost hard to believe. I would give more stars if I could, AMAZING experience.

Its always nice to go where you see a lot of regulars having a good time. Been coming here for a little while now and they are so spot on with the drinks every time. If you need to get out and meet cool people this is the place.

The staff is so friendly and smooth.  They don't stress during busy rushes like some places. The Ricochet Rabbit is my favorite thanks to Kelsey.

I drive all the way into Seattle just to go here which is about 20 minutes out. When I think about going to Pike's, I know Von's is waiting. I love the decor, the lighting, the food, the drinks..........AND, dun da da DAAAAAhhhhh, the beignet's are little cushions of happy. I was out and about doing some photography when started to get a little hungry, plus it was beer-thirty. The glowing sign peeked out and caught my attention. I went in to order a stout and the cinnamon sugar beignets and from that moment I was hooked. I knew, just from the menu, there was more deliciousness to come. I wasn't wrong.  They have an aged old eloquent selection of liquors on a lovely glass shelf with little cards that indicate what it is and pricing, plus a full bar, and nice beer on tap. They have really good cocktails and it's always fun to spin the wheel and see what you can get a discount on for the next thirty minutes. The staff is really nice and accommodating and I just have the best time when I go in there. The burgers are unique and good, the pizza is amazing, the pasta is delicious, and the salmon soup/stew with a nice chunk of sourdough soaking in the bowl is heavenly. I've ordered that twice. It's just great and I'm running out of adjectives to describe it. Just go in, sit down, and enjoy yourself."

Went last night and had a more than wonderful evening. Our incredible waiter Joe was finishing his last shift before moving to Hawaii,playfully joked with us throughout the evening, recommending great drinks and entrees. We all left full, a littled tipsy and laughing. Perfect."

Loved it. The wall of spirits was impressive. Try to Corpse Reviver cocktail - really good. We also enjoyed a Fric (sourdough pizza) which was also really good.

We came in on a fluke, just walking by. had not seen the place before. The steak salad was yummy, and the fries were delicious! This place has a timeliness guarantee for lunch. Not too busy when we came, but key for a lunchtime rush. Recommended."

Although, this week I attempted the Monster. Clearly, I was not going to finish this behemoth version of a double-double in five minutes, but was worth a try. The meat in all the burgers is well seasoned and a tender pink. I also recommend Alchemist Peanuts if you enjoy a salty buttery finish in your mouth. Just waiting for my Chocolate Cake on a Cloud and a larger pair of pants."
