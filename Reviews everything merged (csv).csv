A+ Hong Kong Kitchen,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/a-hong-kong-kitchen-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Kady C.,2,5/21/2017,16,OR,"We came here with high expectations, but were disappointed. We got the curry fish balls, xo sauce rice noodle, cold lemon tea, ice coffee tea, and four other desserts. The curry fish ball doesn't taste like expected, taste noting like something you would find in Hong Kong, the XO sauce noodle was really good actually, would definitely order again. The drink was blend and bitter, no sweetness at all. All the desserts were lacking in flavor. Felt like something you get out of the package, especially the sesame and tofu mix. Service was also another disappointment."
A+ Hong Kong Kitchen,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/a-hong-kong-kitchen-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Eden G.,3,02/01/2018,11,WA,"I was there the first time last night with my friend and ordered the chicken rice porridge, fish Malay soup, red bean w tofu & purple sticky rice w coconut milk for desserts. The entire meal was not extraordinary. Except for the rice porridge, the price is around which is fair for the large amount of food. The workers look tired but attentive."

They have noodle soup and dumplings. The food was very tasty, and different as many of the flavors are not typical in Western foods. I would come back for sure. Only downside here is that it is so popular there is always a line out the door. Staff is friendly and efficient as well."

But it is worth the wait. Been here twice and cant wait for my next visit. The flavors are unique but delicious.

A+ Hong Kong Kitchen,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/a-hong-kong-kitchen-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Christina G.,5,6/26/2024,83,TX,"A+ Hong Kong Kitchen delivers a satisfying dining experience with a variety of flavorful dishes. The Stir Fried Rice Roll With XO Sauce stood out with its great savory taste from the XO sauce, perfectly cooked exterior with a slight crust, and a soft inside--definitely a dish worth repeating. The Baked Portuguese Chicken Rice featured a nice cheesy crust on top, tasting like Thai curry with some vegetables mixed in. The Salted Pork & Chinese Sausage Rice Stone Pot, complemented by a side of Chinese greens, was a solid choice. Pro-tip: let the rice sit for a bit to get a nice crust on the bottom. The pork was tender and flavorful, while the sausage was standard but paired well with the crispy rice. The side of greens was good, nothing special.For dessert, the Mango Sago Pomelo with Purple Rice was tasty but I wish it had more purple rice and sago, though the mango sago itself was nice. The Grass Jelly with Mango was good despite the mango not being fully ripe and the grass jelly coming from a can; the condensed milk paired nicely with the ingredients, though more of it would have been better. The Mango Smoothie with Coconut Milk and Sago was sweet and tasty, with a strong mango flavor that paired well with the coconut milk and sago. I would come back just for this drink.Service was quick and attentive, with hot tea served at no charge and water available upon request. It's small inside and there's not a lot of seating but it's cozy that way. Overall, A+ Hong Kong Kitchen offers a delightful array of dishes that make it worth a visit."

One of their staff told me that this is their first week opening, so their business is very slow. I was there for an hour and no one walks in. I was first scared because I wonder if it's because their food is not good, but I'm glad I didn't walked out! I had there seafood congee, it came out the same as the photos they have. Can tell that the ingredients were in high quality. I got offered a milk tea sample before my meal and a dessert sample after my meal! Wow, am I in Costco? I highly recommend this place if you want to stay away from those Americanized Chinese food. Can't find sweet and sour here, but a lot of other options that are new to try. Will definitely come back for their dessert."

For people that know my food preferences, they will tell you that Chinese food is my least favorite cuisine, but I stumble upon some gems every now and then. I came here one afternoon with friends after having a meeting downtown. They seat us right away and explain the menu to us. We ordered some baked rice, noodle soup, chicken wings, drinks and dessert.

So we waited an hour for a table and then two groups of 4 showed up and the girl at the front wanted to seat us at the bar instead. I told her we waited an hour for the table and the groups just showed up. But her excuse was the table was for bigger groups. They why make us wait an hour. She was so rude about it and just wanted a bigger tip. I'll never come here, the staff is incompetent, rude and money hungry. The food didn't look good anyways. Go to the hummus place next door, they are better and cheaper. Don't believe everything you see on TikTok."

It was pretty tender and flavorful. The breading was perfectly crispy, and the oroshi sauce added a nice kick of flavor. However, I have to say that I preferred the Kurobuto Katsu, which had an even juicier meat quality that was simply delicious. The portion sizes were generous, and the service was attentive without being intrusive. Overall, I give it 3/5! If you're looking for a tonkastu restaurant this will do it justice"

The outer layer of bread crumbs is fried golden and crispy, and when you bite it, you can feel the perfect contrast of crispy outside and tender inside. The cheese melts under high temperature, and the rich milky aroma that flows out blends with the tender pork cutlet, which is endless aftertaste."

TL;DR place is not worth lol. but read more to find out why. - the food was honestly mediocre at best. the tastiest thing I had tonight was the corn cheese but that's honestly really hard to get wrong so... but we got the small beef feast combo and it just did not live up to expectations. the meat quality was okay don't get me wrong, but the flavor was MISSING. not to mention the array or lack thereof, of sauces was NOT that girl. I think like for the $120 price for two, definitely worth taking it somewhere else because of the lack of taste alone. the beef tartare was actually the best thing 2nd to the corn cheese that night. But honestly, Meet's meat was not giving and im sad bc I was looking forward to eating here.- the restaurant does give a nice vibe for a date night. So that's a +- our server was great! I think she did her best at being attentive while juggling the bar. I will say that I wish we got some of our side dishes out sooner and they did forget our corn cheese sometimes so we had to bug about it but I felt bad since she was already doing her best. all the love to her she was getting worked.overall: not goodnot rlly giving the way i wish meet was going to but oh well. don't make the same mistake we did"

But not in a good way. But also not in a bad way.Let me explain. The quality of the meats is exceptional - each cut was incredibly flavorful and tender. The presentation was also top-notch, with beautiful marbling and careful attention to detail.However, while the quality was undeniable, the quantity left me wanting more. The portions were smaller than I expected, and I did not find myself satiated after ordering even several dishes. Good for my waistline, not so good for my wallet. For the price, I would have liked more generous servings.As someone who prefers an all-you-can-eat (AYCE) style, I personally missed the abundance of meat that usually comes with it. While I might sacrifice a bit of quality for a more fulfilling meal, I can't deny that the few bites I had at Meet Korean BBQ were delicious.If you're seeking a high-end Korean BBQ experience with exquisite meats and impeccable service, Meet Korean BBQ is a great choice. However, if you're looking for a more budget-friendly option or prefer larger portions, this might not be the ideal spot for you."

The whole process from making a reservation to the meal its self is so out dated. The decorations were out dated and the food was mediocre at best. I used to go here as a kid with my family. i don't think we had the money to pay $80 a person. I don't think the quality has gone up. But the prices sure have. Initially I was so excited to have so many options. But I wasn't impressed with the options that were given and ended up with just a small plateful of food. I didn't get my moneys worth.Not sure where all the money is going but its not to upgrade the building. They have the best view of Seattle but the building seems like its falling apart.Another thing, it would be nice to know I wouldn't be eating in the main dining room prior to booking my reservation. The down stairs feels like a banquet room and not a restaurant and it did not impress anyone around me. I over heard my ""neighbors"" with the same complaint.Perhaps under new ownership and with an updated feel I would come again for the VIEW!!!"

I would give it a negative rating if I could. I had the WORST experience at the Salty's in Seattle on Alki Beach. I went there for a friends birthday party. We got drinks at the bar and they didn't have premium liquor, so we went for lesser liquor and made it a double...well that was a mistake because apparently bartenders there think that means you get charged 3 drinks instead of the double price. My cosmo got spilled at the table more than half full and she asked if I wanted another, I said no, I was switching to beer, usually restaurants will take the drink off your bill or discount it if more than half was spilled, but this one doesn't. Long story short, we went to the bar, paid our tab, and left. Our friends texted us later asking if we paid our bill, because they were accusing us of dining and dashing. I had to call the manager and tell him we had our card back, because we paid it and they gave it back to us. The manager looked it up and saw that we DID pay, but it wasn't enough. There was added drinks on our tab and I had to argue with the manager about what we ordered. He basically called me a liar and we were charged us more than we had. We ended up paying more than double what we should have. AND the manager was a total jerk about it. I have NEVER been treated so badly at a restaurant in my life. The manager was one of the rudest people I have EVER dealt with in the restaurant business. I will NEVER go back to this establishment or recommend it to ANYONE, unless you want to be treated like crap by the staff and management and pay too much for crappy drinks...."

We have 12 in our party and were told to make two reservations of six. When the reservations person returned our call to confirm the reservation weeks later, we were told me could only make one reservation at one time and that we were only confirmed for 6. Also that we could only be at our table for one and a half hours. We then chose another place to make reservations.That being said, Salty's has been a great place to dine and we have only had great experiences there. Thank you for reading."

In June, there was a surf and turf special with top sirloin and halibut for $24.99 so we thought we'd give it another try. Since the special didn't come with a salad, we decided to order one on the side. We should have got a clue when the waiter said the $9.50 salad wasn't enough to split. We ordered 2 salads that were so tiny they were a joke. The salad was ONE leaf of romaine with some chopped tomatoes, etc on top. Geez - how expensive is lettuce? We were never offered any bread, so we guessed it wasn't included. Some of the surrounding tables had a basket of crackers, we never got those either. I guess you didn't get any unless you asked. The halibut was nicely prepared - all 3 ounces. The steak was a generous portion and very good, but since we mostly came for the seafood, it was disappointing. In retrospect, we should have complained at the time, we just think we won't go back.The view is great."

Great, great atmosphere and view of Seattle skyline. The last three visits my steak was rubbery and ploorly cooked.  This Christmas Eve buffet cost 110 per person. The food was an average Sunday afternoon brunch. Nothing special for the holidays. Prime rib was chewy and tasteless. The drinks were good but pricey. The service was slow and easily forgettable. When we arrived we were put in an outdoor tent with polyurethane floors under the decking. Everything smelled of tarps. My date was NOT impressed. We moved to another table by grand central beverage department. In a positive note, we loved The decorations and vibe."

We started with clam chowder. It's among the best. Then, we shared an Alaskan King Crab leg. Not as fresh as we're used to. At $85, a little disappointing. Our main course was the scallops plate with rice cakes. This was a real treat. We had a little room for dessert and went with the berries shortcake. It promised to be drenched in berry saurce. It was more desert than dessert. The angel food cake was more dense than the norm and there was a serious shortage of sauce. We're glad Salty's is open for indoor dining.

While the weather wasn't particularly cooperative, with a less than spectacular view of the sky line, the service was on the whole, above average. Our dedicated server was friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. It's hard to go wrong when you take friends to breakfast here, as there truly is something for everybody. I want to love ""the best eggs benedict"" in Seattle, they claim to serve, but I always seem to hit the chafing dish at the wrong time. Not to worry, there are soooo many other options. The build your own omelette is fantastic and the young man working the station was just a DOLL. The mini waffles are amazing and there's no shortage of topping options. These are the best I've had, anywhere. My personal favorite is the ginourmous barrel of Dungeness Crab. They have drawn butter o n hand, but WHY? There truly is no need, as the crab is always fresh (you can see the tanks of the little buddies waving at you in the window as you walk in) and delicious.Multiple trips are necessary, as there's the chocolate fountain to consider...YUM and the desert table. I found some of the deserts hit or miss; the cream puffs and bread pudding were meh, though the caramel sauce (on the pudding) was fantastic (i'll take a cup of that to go, please) and my black bottom cupcake was dry and tasteless. The mini passion fruit tarts were fantastic, and I'm kicking myself in retrospect for not having a few more.All in all, Salty's is a Seattle tradition and a wonderful place to take out of town visitors. There is no way to walk away hungry and when the weather cooperates the view is breathtaking!"

As someone who has worked in a lot of restaurants it amazes me that people get so upset when they aren't sat exactly at their reservation time. A reservation guarantees that you have priority for that time over someone who just walks in the door. It also enables a resaturant to at least try to staff accordingly. But there are a lot of variables involved. What is the restaurant supposed to do with the diners who linger for 2 1/2 hours? What if they have sick staff. Maybe the kitchen is struggling that night and needs an extra five minutes to catch up before the next wave of guests orders. Have a little more consideration for a hostess who is trying to accomodate the needs of staff and guest alike. Not everyone can sit at a window at the same time. Also, I noticed that people talk about slow service. HAve you looked at how physically huge Salty's is? Did you pay attention to how long the walk PAST THE KITCHEN to your table was. Your server makes that walk at a dash every time you demand your FREE bread, your extra condiments and your ""lemon for you water."" If you are DOWNSTAIRS on the patio, how long do you think it would take you to run up the stairs each time you need a fresh drink or another basket of carb loaded bread? Use some common sense when making reviews based on things like slow seating or service."

I had to take my time to write this review because the experience I had here was truly exceptional. The view from the restaurant is phenomenal; you can see the whole city of Seattle over the ocean. It's so beautiful. The host was helpful, although she could be a bit more welcoming, remembering that she is the face of the house (I must mention that I was mistaken about my reservation, and she kindly helped me). However, the rest of my experience was amazing.Our server, Chrissy, was unlike any I've ever encountered. She was incredibly professional, knowledgeable about the menu, and detailed in explaining how each dish was prepared. It was an unbelievable experience, and if you visit, make sure to ask for her. She will give you a dining experience like no other. The highlight of my visit was definitely her service.The food was outstanding. We tried the clam chowder, which was excellent, and the mimosas, which came in different flavors and were delightful. The salmon was incredibly flavorful, and the appetizers were amazing. Every aspect of my dining experience at this restaurant was fantastic, and I will definitely be returning.A special thanks to Chrissy for her phenomenal service and for creating such a wonderful experience for us. She truly elevated the art of serving to a whole new level. I would also like to mention the manager who came to our table; it was a nice touch. Overall, I would give this place 10 stars because five stars are simply not enough for this exceptional restaurant."

The service has always been excellent - friendly servers, always feel welcome, and the food has never been late. I've enjoyed most everything I've ever ordered.

The atmosphere is nice, welcoming, and spacious. It has an under water theme and love how they put down brown paper for a fast clean up of the mess that you will make. The food is so good!!! The crabs taste fresh and the spicy oceanic sauce is a nice taste of fresh flavors.They had a daily special that consisted of lobster, pineapple, and Mac n cheese which was one of the best meals I've ever had and literally cannot stop thinking about. The flavors complimented each other nicely. I do hope they will have this special for awhile or even make it permanent because everyone should be as blessed to try this.

It is a Seattle institution. It is loved. I have been to no less than 3 big events and many dinners at Salty's... so I know my way around the menu and the place. The event room underneath is probably the most romantic and beautiful places in all of Seattle to have a wedding reception. It is large, open and has (just like the restaurant above) a fantastic view. If you are in the restaurant the best place for a seat are the corner windows... there are only 2 of them and the one on the northern side is best.There really is a great view from pretty much everywhere in the joint, but the corners are the best.The oysters are always a favorite as well as the salmon. I am not really a fan of the beef here.. or anywhere... but my blood thirsty friends seem to appreciate it.Local brews and wines can be found. The service is awesome. If it is your birthday you might get a free white cake slice. MIGHT. I think 3 out of the 5 or 6 times I went for birthdays, the waiter offered the cake. It must depend on who is working that day. The cake is amazing."

Kokkaku,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kokkaku-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Tara B.,3,08/03/2019,12,WA,"Place is sooo overpriced.There was no other patron there except us checking it out for dinner at 5:30pm on a weekday, and later on there was a couple who arrived at 7pm or so. There were 3 people behind the bar and around the service area of the restaurant so there was definitely plenty of service.Food was good, but the menu shows expensive beef (like Butcher's Table and Ruth Chris' prices) but the restaurant feels more casual. Perhaps they can knock off the price a little to reflect the location and casual feel so there will be more people coming."
Kokkaku,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kokkaku-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Nancy M.,4,6/21/2022,7,WA,"Taste for some dishes are pretty surprising and special compared to other Japanese restaurant, price is reasonable and service is good. Only complain is the serve speed is a tad slow."
Kokkaku,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kokkaku-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Robert B.,4,1/30/2021,24,WA,"If you like quality steak, I would check this place out. They make a delicious medium-rare."

Kokkaku,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kokkaku-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Paul G.,5,11/05/2024,3,WA,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Kokkaku in Seattle's U-District, and it was an unforgettable experience. This place is a paradise for meat lovers, with an amazing Japanese twist on classic favorites like steak and burgers. I ordered a burger, and it was easily one of the best I've ever had. The flavors were incredibly balanced, and the meat was cooked to absolute perfection. The ambiance is cozy yet modern, making it a great spot for anything from a casual meal to a special night out. The staff were warm, welcoming, and attentive, adding to the overall positive experience.For anyone in the U-District looking for a unique and delicious dining experience focused on high-quality meats, I highly recommend it"

The chef and staff at Kokkaku have truly mastered the art of delivering an extraordinary dining affair.The moment I stepped in, I was greeted by an ambiance that seamlessly combined elegance with a warm, inviting atmosphere. However, it was the culinary performance that stole the show. The chef's skillful maneuvers with the knife and precision on the grill were nothing short of mesmerizing. It was a culinary spectacle that left me in awe.The steaks at Kokkaku are, without a doubt, the best I've ever tasted in the country. The quality of the meat was exceptional, and the preparation was flawless. Each bite was a symphony of flavors, perfectly seared on the outside and tender on the inside. I've never encountered anything quite like this in my culinary adventures.What sets Kokkaku apart is its ability to outshine even the most upscale steakhouses. The authenticity of the Japanese culinary techniques, combined with the impeccable service, creates an experience that transcends the ordinary. This is not just a meal; it's a journey into the world of exquisite flavors and culinary artistry.In conclusion, Kokkaku Japanese Steakhouse is a gem that deserves every bit of praise. It has redefined my expectations of what a steakhouse can deliver. If you're a connoisseur of fine dining and appreciate the mastery of culinary craftsmanship, Kokkaku is an absolute must-visit.

Definitely go for the brunch - it's the best value and their brunch buffet table has delicious food (although it's a lot of food to eat since you still get the same meat experience as dinner). I've come here for dinner as well, and I highly recommend the dessert! The key lime pie especially was so good!"

It is wide and spacious: perfect for social distancing! The quality and portion of the steak were great, and it was also nice that there were options for a side of onion rings or french fries. The interior golf practice room made this restaurant unique, and I have never seen one before at a restaurant.I am not a professional about the steak!"
Kokkaku,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kokkaku-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Samantha W.,5,11/29/2018,6,WA,One word...Wagyu. It is absolutely amazing. The seared wagyu is to die for.

The oil they fry it in makes it taste funny and it's not as fluffy or tasteful as I am use to. The drinks are good and the other food there is pretty good too. This place has a good happy hour.

The chicken and waffles were super tender and juicy. Waffles were so fluffy and really light to eat. They have a great selection of drinks and it's a good spot for happy hour. Awesome cocktail with cool taste. The service was fine. Awesome place and for dates because of its intimate vibe. I will visit again for more.

The pricing is fair.Let's start with the drinks, as I believe they pay the most attention to their cocktails. Very pretty presentation and enjoyable taste, very smooth.For food, most of it can be shared, because the portions are generous and the plates are huge. My friend and I went by yelp recommendations and chose the chicken waffle, which was not bad.We also tried the french fries and 3 burger set which I don't remember the name, sorry.Definitely deserves a chance, the cocktails will have you coming back."

Witness,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/witness-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Gypsy G.,4,10/12/2017,57,WA,"My friends and I visited Witness on a Wednesday evening at 6:30pm, and the place was hopping. Although there are no reservations, we were lucky enough to get a table for 4 right near the front of the restaurant. It was a little chilly that night whenever the door opened, so you may want to bring a layer that you'll want to wear while you eat. Food was great and were of relatively large proportions for a Seattle trendy/hipster restaurant. Most of us ordered the pork sliders, which were oddly good even though they didn't have the traditional BBQ sauce on the side. And those french fries - I could have shoved them all in my face at once, but managed to contain myself. Everyone liked the cocktails they ordered. I had the Orlando, which was delicious. All in all, a good night. We'll try to return here for their brunch, and just in general, because I think you get a lot of bang for your buck here. The only downside was that they could turn down their music just a touch."
Witness,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/witness-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Lindsay M.,4,5/31/2017,7,CA,Had breakfast with some friends one morning.

The one dish I like the most is the chicken and waffles, the chicken strips are great but the waffle is really the star of the dish. I have been to Roscoes in California and I like their chicken better but this is pretty good. The decor is cool as well"
Witness,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/witness-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Ewa H.,4,3/25/2016,7,WA,"Excellent food, great feeling and great owner. Can not ask for much more than that. Greg the owner greeted us at the pub and we talked with him about the way in which the restaurant was going and he looked like a fine and funny man. We ate the Chicken and Waffles, the Shrimp and Grits, and Beignets and all were superb. They make a great sazerac, my favourite beverage that I order at many pubs but few are great. My wife had a Black as Pitch which was rum, stout along with a whole uncooked egg and it was quite yummy too. Yet another great place on the hill added to our repertoire."

Everything that comes out of the kitchen looks warm, delicious, and freshly prepared. A lady sat next to us at the bar one night eating the pork belly special, and it smelled so good I wanted to take it off her plate.But back to the drinks- they're so fun here! I think I like everything on the menu, especially those drinks containing whiskey :). The bartenders are really knowledgeable about their alcohol selection and will recommend different whiskeys to try neat if you let them know what type of flavors/ bodies of whiskey you prefer. I love when bartenders take time to cater to your tastes, and this place definitely does that! I also love their cocktail with an egg white in it. I know it sounds gross! But the egg white gave the cocktail a creamy, smooth texture without adding any weird taste to it. I asked her to put an egg white in my second cocktail (which she completely made up) and it was just as good! Weird finding- guess I like egg whites in my whiskey cocktails. Gotta thank Witness for opening up that door for me though!"

The secret, I'm told by someone in the know, is the buttermilk brine. Huge portions means you get to enjoy it again tomorrow. Or come REALLY hungry. Great cocktails and an enormous selection of booze. I think they could make you damn near anything you wanted with exactly the booze you want in it. Highly recommend."

Their Shrimp Po' Boy is likely my favorite dish, closely followed by their chicken and waffles with bourbon maple syrup!On this most recent trip we got the chicken and waffles, but also changed it up with their new ratatouille.This was different than I was expecting, it was much more of a salad with greens than what I think of as ratatouille. The crunchy okra (I believe) was a great addition though. Not bad, but much more salad-y than I was expecting.As whenever I get it, the chicken was nice and crunchy with light fluffy waffles!"
Witness,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/witness-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Sarah S.,5,10/27/2018,12,WA,"Both mine and my friend were utterly stuffed after our meal here. I had the grit meal, and you might be thinking ""grits, as a meal, that's it?"" I can assure you, it is gourmet grits, with bacon bits (way better than dollar store variety) and a sunny-side up egg smack dab in the middle of the dish. My friend had the chicken and waffles and she claimed that she was full for the next 9 hours.The atmosphere is full of reclaimed wood and church pews are used as the booths. There's surprisingly plenty of room for groups at the pew tables and multiple groups throughout the restaurant. The food comes relatively quick. One thing: the food is clean, not overtly grease and doesn't *feel* unhealthy. But there is a lack of veggies and stuff, and that's to be expected. It's ""clean southern"", if that makes sense?"

Witness,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/witness-seattle?not_recommended_start=50,John K.,5,12/02/2014,5,WA,"I started with a cocktail, I got the Son of a Preacher Man which was bourbon with black tea, lemon, and honey liqueur. I'm typically not a big cocktail guy but I thought it was really good, struck a nice balance between the bourbon and the sweetness. For food I ordered the Chicken and Waffles, and I will say the fried chicken was definitely worth the hype. They're chicken tender style so they're boneless, the meat was moist, and the skin was perfectly seasoned and flaky, and wasn't excessively oily/greasy like typical fried chicken. The waffles were good, but really waffles are just waffles, hard to mess up waffles. Waffles.Atmosphere was good and has a nice vibe to it, classy and clean but still manages to be pretty casual. Price point is a tad bit high, and for that if I could give it 4.5 stars I would, but overall it was pretty damn good so I'll round up."

The White Swan Public House,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-white-swan-public-house-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Matthew H.,1,7/20/2024,5,TX,"I recently went here after many times walking around SLU and thinking this place would be a nice ambiance to eat at. Unfortunately the ambiance is the only thing worth enjoying here. It took probably 15-20 minutes to receive our order of ""crab"" hush puppies which probably had less crab than crab rangoons at a takeout place. The huhshpuppies tasted like fried oil and the honey butter did not pair well. The drink my wife ordered, the San Junipero, was quite tasty and smooth! It took another 20 minutes after we finished our appetizer to order our main entrees and I was intrigued by the Elk entree. The unfortunate result was that the Elk had almost no flavor and was sitting on a bed of gnocchi that tasted like a Mediterranean pasta and had no business being plated with an Elk steak covered in capers. My wife ordered the fish-witch and I don't think I've seen her more disinterested in a sandwich before. It was incredibly salty like it had been cruising on the sound for hours, and had the texture of jerky. What's unfortunate is the dish was supposed to come with an aioli but they gave her ketchup which did not provide much comfort to the ass'salted' sandwich. I would say to only come here if you're looking for a good ambiance and tasty drinks, otherwise the meal is not worth the price."

We had a vegetarian with a group of us and they couldn't eat at all. The service was slow and often we felt forgotten by the server. Drinks were over priced and the vibe just isn't that friendly from the staff or management. Sadly this spot has had some great bars that were alot of fun and always packed, this place does not have that going on for it. We live close but we won't be going back."

Stateside,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/stateside-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=0,Hanna B.,2,05/09/2019,6,NC,"This was one of the most disappointing meals I have ever had. I ate here in July 2018 while visiting Seattle, and saw that this was rated Seattle's best restaurant in 2015, but it completely underwhelmed my expectations.The food was incredibly average, unseasoned, and the presentation of some of the dishes was confusing or annoying. Drinks: the cocktails were actually very good, so if you want to go for a cocktail and a small plate or two it may not be a bad idea. I had the pineapple margarita. There is rum in it, and I am not a huge rum fan, but the smokey tastes of grilled pineapple and mezcal really complimented the light sweetness of the drink.Food, We had: -The crispy duck fresh rolls, which were just mediocre Peking duck. I don't know why they tried make it seem like they were reinventing the wheel here.- A pork dish small plate where the waiter presented the dish with a 60-second explanation of how to eat it. The dish was written on the menu as a small pork bites with dipping sauces. In reality, the dish was designed as pork on taco-like shells made of vermicelli noodles, and the sauces were meant to be drizzled on top of these ""tacos"". 1) Vermicelli noodles should NEVER be used as taco shells. 2) If your dish needs 60 seconds of explanation, you should not be serving it. The pork and the wraps were way too chewy to be able to be eaten as it was designed, as you could not easy just take a bite at a time. -Goat curry - this was the only dish that tasted seasoned. But I would be impressed if someone was serving an unseasoned curry...-A noodle dish - the noodles here seemed to be angel hair pasta rather than an Asian rice noodle. Which made the dish difficult to eat and share, as pasta is much more chewy than a rice noodle. Overall, I was left annoyed and dissatisfied, but it certainly not the worst meal I have ever had. Just one where I was left annoyed by my meal. I would have given 1 star if I hadn't enjoyed the drink."
Stateside,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/stateside-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=0,Jay K.,2,2/28/2016,123,WA,"I was expecting more from Stateside. I think it's overrated and too expensive for the tastes and portions it offers. I found the rice paper of the crispy duck rolls too dry and the sauce that went with it too salty. The black cod entr�e cost $28 and only had three tiny pieces of cod, it's a rip-off. The goat curry was my favorite. Their beer selection is too limited for a beer city like Seattle, only three beers on drafts, two of them very light lagers and just one IPA. I like a bigger beer variety. The decoration and ambience were nice. But, overall, not a good value restaurant."
Stateside,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/stateside-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=0,Paige G.,3,1/18/2019,17,WA,"Was OK, but really overpriced. I will not be going back or recommending to others."

I decided to dine at Stateside. I must emphasize that this restaurant provided us with one of the most exceptional customer experiences we've encountered since our move in August.Food QualityAs avid food enthusiasts, we love exploring diverse items on the menu. Here's what we had: Crispy Duck Fresh Rolls, Ahi Tuna Crudo, Sticky Rice Dumplings, Crunchy and Creamy Chili-Garlic Prawns, and Goat Curry.Firstly, I anticipated the Crispy Duck Fresh Rolls to be heavy, but they pleasantly surprised me. The meat quantity was just right and seasoned to perfection. The Ahi Tuna, while the fish was high-quality, suffered an excess of saltiness that overpowered the overall dish.Next, the Sticky Rice Dumplings had too much of a chewy or gummy texture. However, the savory flavors, particularly the mushrooms, compensated for this drawback. The prawns, generously sized and lightly breaded, provided an awesome crunchy texture. Lastly, the Goat Curry not only smelled amazing but also lived up to its tasty expectations. The curry maintained a thickness, avoiding excessive liquidity. Regrettably, we set aside the tuna and dumplings, choosing not to finish them.Customer ServiceOur server, Michael, left a lasting mark on our dining experience. His profound knowledge of the menu, coupled with his friendly and attentive demeanor, was impressive. Midway through our meal, he noticed our hesitation with the two dishes we had set aside and kindly prompted for our feedback. He listened to our concerns which led to a thoughtful replacement of the dumplings with the Crispy Mushroom Fresh Rolls, a suggestion that did not disappoint! Michael's exceptional service exceeded our expectations, which has become rare in our dining experiences, and we truly appreciated it. As a result, I've decided to give this restaurant a well-earned 4-star rating. Will we be back? Absolutely."

My wife and I were very happy with our drinks. She had the lemongrass Manhattan and I had the cassia mule. My mule had a strong ginger taste, and I found it to be quite refreshing. We also shared the grilled pork collar and crispy chicken. The pork was pretty tasty, but definitely needed the sauces that are served on the side. Without the sauces, I think I would have been a little underwhelmed. And I felt that was even more the case with the chicken. While it was perfectly crispy, there didn't seem to be much seasoning and flavor to it. The sauce helped a bit, but I thought the dish could have been just a little better. Overall we had a very nice meal, and I certainly would go back again to try more dishes."

From the moment I entered, I knew I was in for a treat.Let's start with the appetizer, the mushroom summer rolls. These rolls were a testament to the creativity and innovation present at Stateside. The combination of mushrooms and fresh ingredients resulted in a burst of flavors that delighted my taste buds. Each bite was filled with freshness and the rolls were expertly crafted, showcasing the skill of the chefs in creating a unique and delicious dish.Moving on to the standout dish, the spicy shrimp, it unquestionably stole the show. The perfect balance of heat and flavors made it an instant favorite. In fact, we loved it so much that we ordered two servings for the table, and ended up ordering two more! The succulent shrimp were cooked to perfection, and the spicy sauce added a delightful kick that left us craving for more. It was undoubtedly the highlight of the menu.Next, we indulged in the goat curry. While the flavors were familiar, Stateside managed to elevate the dish to new heights. The curry was expertly prepared, and the goat was tender and infused with the aromatic spices. The dish was a symphony of flavors, transporting us to the streets of Vietnam with every mouthful.We also had the pleasure of savoring the fish and noodles dish, which was a delightful combination of freshness and taste. The fish was cooked to perfection, flaky and moist, while the noodles provided a satisfying texture. The flavors were vibrant and well-balanced, showcasing the attention to detail in each component of the dish.However, one area where Stateside could improve is in providing more vegetarian options. While the mushroom summer rolls were a fantastic choice, those seeking a meatless meal might find limited options on the menu. Expanding the vegetarian offerings would attract a wider range of diners and cater to various dietary preferences.On to the beverages, I ordered the coconut drink, and it was a delightful surprise. The innovative presentation, coupled with the refreshing taste of coconut, created a truly enjoyable drinking experience. It was evident that Stateside took pride in crafting unique and delightful beverages that complemented the culinary journey.Lastly, the dessert was an indulgent finale to the meal. Though the details were not provided, the decadent nature of the dessert speaks volumes. Stateside clearly knows how to satisfy one's sweet tooth and provide a memorable ending to the dining experience.Overall, Stateside is a Vietnamese restaurant that stands out for its innovative flavors and culinary expertise. From the mushroom summer rolls to the exceptional spicy shrimp and well-executed goat curry, the dishes were a testament to the skill and passion of the chefs. While vegetarian options could be expanded, the flavors and overall experience were undeniably delightful. Coupled with the innovative coconut drink and decadent desserts, Stateside offers a Vietnamese culinary journey that is worth embarking upon."

Much of the menu has changed, but new flavors were as interesting and delicious as before. I think the only repeats were the duck rolls and the chili cumin ribs which were just as amazing as before. We had a party of 5 adults and 2 children (adventurous eaters) and shared everything family style. We had the mushroom rolls, the pork collar, the masterstock crispy chicken, goat curry, clam rice, tamarind braised short ribs, flowering cauliflower, jasmine and ginger rice, salt cured duck egg, and the cha ca la vong. For desert we split all the items on the menu. Everything was very delicious and the salt cured duck egg added a salty creaminess to every dish I pared it with. The short ribs and the cumin ribs were my favorite with a close second being the masterstock crispy chicken and the pork collar. My favorite desert was the duck/goose egg custard. The service was top-notch and our server and the owner answered all the questions we had about the menu. This being the second time, I would say that it still remains the pinnacle of my dining experiences. I would recommend anything on the menu."

The food is an excellent combination of the fresh vibrant flavors of vietnamese food as well as the rich layered flavors seen in excellent french dishes. The pumpkin curry and beet tartar with buttered cilantro toast were amazing vegetarian choices as well as the pork ribs thrown in cumin seed and chili flakes almost fell off the bone. The decor includes a minty colour palette, classic tropical background and distressed mirrors. Though this eatery is in the center of the active Pike-Pine corridor, it somehow feels comfy and tucked away. I'll definitely be going back to Stateside. Outstanding!!!"

Really more French-Vietnamese than traditional Vietnamese, this place is fantastic. Somewhat limited menu, but truly one that rings of ""quality over quantity"". The setting is very nice, even though the restaurant space was originally a garage. Service was great despite it being busy. Everybody who's been here has probably tried the cumin pork ribs, which are very potent (don't get it if you hate cumin). Also got frog legs and master stock chicken, both of which really packed in the flavor. The chicken is a very safe bet, but this is the kind of place where you should definitely try go beyond your conservative palate. Can't go wrong with any of the desserts (my personal favorite was the frozen cinnamon souffle, so cinnaminny). Would definitely go again, and it's certainly a good place to share with friends."

Marination Ma Kai,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/marination-ma-kai-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Mike W.,1,2/21/2021,7,WA,Absolutely terrible Seafood. I was looking forward to trying it out for once. The fish tastes like Gordon fisherman quality. The fries were over cooked and they only give you two smaller pieces of fish that did not taste that good at all. I think Gorton's fisherman fish taste better than this crap. Don't mean to be harsh however when do you expect good quality seafood in the Pacific Northwest and you get this that's worse than frozen food quality fish. This is the first and last time I'll ever go here unless there is a big change.

Marination Ma Kai,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/marination-ma-kai-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Nevaeh W.,2,06/07/2024,4,WA,"I've been a fan of Marination Ma Kai for some time now. The food is is always good. The service is generally fine, with the staff being friendly and attentive.However, I've had hair in my food multiple times, which raises serious concerns about their cleanliness and food safety practices. This repeated issue is disappointing and needs urgent attention.After this last instance, I probably will be staying away for a while. It's a shame because the food and service are great, but until the cleanliness issues are addressed, I can't see myself returning."

Sorry the Loco Moco price is outrageous. It should be worth $4.25. Only one hamburger pattie. Also, its just a plain hamburger pattie not mixed with onions or worcestershire sauce."

The portions were definitely not Hawaii sized, and the food was just okay - the teriyaki chicken wasn't anything special or groundbreaking. If I did have to go back I'd get the kimchi fried rice.The menu also didn't wow me with Hawaiian options, so I wouldn't put Marination in my top three favorite Hawaiian restaurants. If you're looking for great Hawaiian food, try Kona Kitchen or Kauai Family Restaurant instead."
Marination Ma Kai,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/marination-ma-kai-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,John D.,3,8/15/2022,13,WA,"I loved the location of this restaurant as its just next to the ferry terminal. The food is good but a bit on the salty side, especially the Spam Musubi. Aloha Fries, Malasadas and Shave Ice are highly recommended. Overall, it was a good experience."
Marination Ma Kai,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/marination-ma-kai-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Ron M.,3,6/29/2022,11,WA,"The location can't be better - right off the water taxi dock with a view of the Seattle skyline. Marination Ma Kai has an outdoor patio but to really sit waterfront, you just use one of the public picnic tables.The food was good, hearty and tasty. I had a Loco Moco (beef patty with two sunny side up eggs on gravy and white rice ), which is flavorful but a little bit on the small side for a real meal. So I also had four tacos (I wish I could just have two but they only do four tacos during the week), which are good too. There are five protein options to mix and match including tofu.However, the whole fast food, self serve vibe makes me wonder if it's worth the big bucks. There are even flies flying around in the utensil area."

We sat outside and enjoyed a perfect sunny evening on the patio with the most excellent view of Puget sound and Seattle skyline. Food is small to modest size, so don't worry if you can't decide....get two items. We ordered kimchi fried rice, loco Mosco and fish and chips to share for 2 people. Perfect! Everything had great flavor. Fish and chips were tender and not too heavily breaded. Look forward to returning."

Islander style on some American classics and Hawaiian comfort food. The Katsu sandwich is also a good choice if your hungry. That thing is huge. The kimchi fried rice was a generous serving and the tacos were the size of street tacos. The fish tacos were also very delicious and had a miso sake glaze on it, then grilled. Everything is bursting with flavor and the portions make sure no one hits the ferry hungry. The environment is nice, family friendly and very relaxing. Definitely would recommend coming here! Hit the spot and can't wait to go again! Great view of the city too."

D'uh, 'nuff said and they have me coming here over and over. Get some tacos, add some sriracha, the fish n chips are delicious, mac salad is the best I've had in Seattle compared to the Real Hawaiian stuff, and they have plenty of crispy cold lagers available so you don't have to grow your beard any further with IPA (unless you want to, they do have them)."

A must do experience if you've never been, and a great place to take visitors to Seattle. Sit on the patio with a local microbrew and some tacos or sliders and look across the water at the incredible Seattle skyline. Located right at the water taxi dock, so even if you're in Seattle it's worth the trip and is a great day out. You can even rent kayaks and paddle boards from the booth located on the street side of the building and make a full day of it. Highly recommended"

I recently dined at this restaurant, and unfortunately, the experience was far from pleasant. The food was very mediocre. It seemed like the restaurant was trying to be creative with the presentation, but the taste was really hit or miss.The real issue, however, came at the end of the meal. When the check arrived, we noticed that our bill had almost doubled, so we pointed this out to our server. If we hadn't caught this, we would have overpaid significantly. When we pointed out the mistake, the server didn't seem genuinely sorry or take the proper steps to correct it. He just returned the original bill with a refunded amount, without providing a corrected receipt or a new printout. As a result, we had to do the calculations ourselves to figure out the final total and calculate the tip, which made us feel like we were responsible for fixing his mistake.Overall, I'm very disappointed with the whole experience. It ruined what was supposed to be a great night. I wouldn't recommend this place unless they improve both their food and customer service."

We were seated immediately & had a nice table. It was pretty crowded & noisy but that didn't bother us, as we can be a little noisy, too. Got our menus & were a little surprised & disappointed that there really wasn't anything that we usually think of as brunch type food. They make their own bread there so where was the French Toast or even egg dishes? There were a lot of things that had some pretty unusual ingredients & one actually had a fried or poached egg on top, but most of our group was not impressed with the menu. The one thing that was actually very good (and that had been recommended to us) was the avocado toast. It was delicious, but had way too much garnishing on top which was pretty, but not really necessary & just got in the way. I probably would have gone with a 3 rating, except the service was not especially good. There were several wait staff hanging around a center service area chatting (including our server) but trying to get their attention when a couple of our guests didn't receive their full order was difficult.

The wait can vary from 10 min to 40 min. The food presentation is pretty and the visual atmosphere is pleasant. However, I agree with many of the other reviewers in terms of overall unprofessional service that needs an upgrade. Once we were seated, we were not offered a menu or water for the first 10 min. The server never introduced herself and she forgot one of our order. Even though there was a long line of people waiting, we didn't get a check and had to finally ask a different server. In general the servers need to smile and be more courteous. I heard one server bad - mouthing one of their table which is so unprofessional and made the experience uncomfortable. I wouldn't buy anything in there item and flower wise since it is so overpriced but the food was delicious and I would come back...I would tentatively recommend this place because I think service can be changed with better management.  P.S. try the tea cake and avocado albacore. Salmon lox portion was ridiculously small for the price. Ice tea is nothing special. Quiche on the first day was divine, second day very gooey. Don't get the scrambled egg, it's rubbery."

We came for dinner on a Tuesday so it wasn't as busy. I'm sure I'm a regular weekend night there would be a lot more people and wait.

Bar Harbor,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/bar-harbor-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,C L.,1,11/22/2020,1,CA,terrible runny tasteless clam chowder.
Bar Harbor,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/bar-harbor-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Jamie M.,1,6/13/2019,6,WA,"I'm very disappointed and upset at how the security is managed at your building. They do nothing about the half naked drunks that ramble out of the bar within or the drug addicts, pot smokers, heroin users on the property or the fact that there is a person that repeatedly sleeps in the gas main cubby whole, but for some reason when someone wants to smoke a cigarette in the alley they are constantly scrutinized. The landscapers and power washers are also disrespectful by consistently blowing all the trash from one side of the alley to the other, instead of removing it. For this being such a high cost building, with such high end tenants you would think that there would be a higher grade of professionalism."

Our bartender is incredibly likeable and so so friendly. He is the reason I felt compelled to write a review. He remembered my parents and their drink order from a few weeks ago, and even remembered that they were here celebrating a birthday. He is nothing but helpful, and he even offered waters to two ladies who said they were killing time standing in the bar when he knew he wouldn't get any business from them. All of the other staff have been cheery and fun so far as well.Apart from the service, the kimchi bloody marys are yummy! $11 apiece is alright, definitely worth how good they are. They have an awesome craft cocktail menu too, can't wait to come back for more!Lastly, the views from the bar are delightful!"

It's like a little East Coast pocket in the city. The lobster rolls? Seriously good stuff - fresh, tasty, and hits the spot every time.They've got a solid selection of canned beers too. Doesn't matter if you're into the usual suspects or wanna try something new, they've probably got a can for that.So, next time you're in SLU and thinking seafood and a chill beer, give Bar Harbor a shot. It's laid-back, friendly, and does the Boston seafood thing right in Seattle."""

I have been waiting for these lobster rolls for months and was not disappointed. The roll itself is incredible, and the lobster portion is perfect. I also had the chowder which is a traditional New England style thin chowder instead of the thick Northwest style and I have to say, the east coasters do it better. The burrata salad was out of this world as well. The place is gorgeous and the whole staff seems really happy to be there. I went in on day one, so there are some minor kinks to work out, but that is just practice. Can't wait for the oysters!"

We showed up right at opening and were the first ones seated. Service was great - the bartender even came over to discuss our cocktails which was a first at any restaurant I've been to.We have loved Jerry Traunfeld's Poppy and ate ate Herbfarm when he was there as well. Dinner was very good overall. We were able to order off of their special gluten free menu which luckily had more than just a couple items. Not an easy thing to do in an Asian cuisine restaurant generally.The numbing vs spicy concept was thankfully explained well by our server. Numb tongue was another first for me! Not quite sure how I felt about it but the flavors of the food we dined on were overall exceptional.

Joule,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/joule-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Nick G.,3,02/03/2010,161,WA,"Joule has a great story behind it. A French husband and an Asian wife cooking together in the kitchen for the perfect blend of perfection. Not so much. While the concept and the menu seemed to be noteworthy the customer service was average and the crab dish and corn bread was all together quite bland to me although I did find a slight glimmer of hope in taste testing my girlfriend's Mackerel. The truth is, to succeed in the food business around the Seattle area you have to:a) Either have EXTREMELY good customer service where people leave the restaurant feeling like they were a part of your family.b) Have EXTREMELY good food, customer service optional at this point.Neither a nor b ring true at Joule.

Since we didn't have a reservation, we sat at the bar counter. Our bartender was phenomenal, expertly guiding us through the menu.Now, let's talk about the food! The spicy rice cakes are an absolute must-try--they're simply delicious. While the steak was a bit too greasy for my taste, it was still tender and flavorful.

I was very excited about this place a couple years ago - several meals I had were outstanding with really innovative dishes and outstanding execution. But I went back for dinner a few nights ago and would say for the most part the meal was just good. I'm kinda tired of paying through the nose for good so probably won't be back for a while. Two standout dishes were the Korean rice cakes with chorizo (and I've always been very happy with how Joule handles rice cake dishes) and the black bean eggplant with garlic. Really stunning and exciting flavors here. The rest - and we had a bunch of other small plates - was just good. The kaya toast (boring, spread was boring too), white stuffed Kim chi ""cake"" (which all tasted like a conventional pickle), bone marrow (giant bone with little marrow but the flavor was good), black sesame noodle (I was expecting a better cold noodle salad. This one lost something in translation; my local QFC makes a tastier Sesame noodle salad...) and I believe we had wagyu skirt steak with pineapple slaw (nice meat, cooked well, just good) was all just good. It was good. Not great. Not excellent. Not amazing. Can someone point me to a restaurant that will consistently delight and dazzle me without requiring a mortgage payment in ransom? Thanks."
Joule,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/joule-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Lindsay M.,4,06/07/2017,7,CA,"Korean fusion. I enjoyed the beef tartare. The bone marrow was meh, as I've had much better for cheaper. The bar is definitely a craft bar."

Excellent atmosphere. Great for weekend brunch. For $19 you can pick one entree + get a free for all at the buffet. For DINNER, however, portions are lacking in size. If you're *hungry*, this may not be the place. But if you're in the mood for small portions and drinks for dinner - it's good. The food is always tasty no matter what."

Joule,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/joule-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Jonathan B.,5,06/06/2023,3,WA,Great restaurant. We really enjoyed the food here. The rice cakes are a must order. The octopus fell a little flat despite ordering it based on a great review of it. The steak was probably the best order. It was their signature short rib steak and it was truly amazing. The greens we ordered with the steak were also money. The cauliflower was just okay. Overall great place for Korean fusion steak. The bar was pretty good to sit at.

From the moment I walked in, the service was prompt, attentive, and friendly. The server provided excellent suggestions, making my dining experience even more enjoyable.Now let's talk about the food - I started with Chinese scallion pancakes, a simple dish executed to perfection. The pancakes were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a subtle yet satisfying flavor.Next up was the tofu steak, which was so delicious that it could convert even the most ardent tofu hater into a tofu lover. The dish was perfectly paired with mushrooms, creating a wonderful umami flavor that lingered on the tongue.Moving on to the rice cakes, I was blown away by the great pairing with the house-made chorizo. The dish had a delectable taste with great flavors and textures that complemented each other well.The Dan Dan noodles were a simple dish that couldn't go wrong. They were cooked to perfection with just the right balance of spice and flavor.Last but certainly not least was the showstopper dish, the short ribs. These were undoubtedly the star of the show, juicy and tender with a perfect balance of flavors. The gochujang spice added a pleasant kick to the dish, making it a truly memorable experience.Overall, the restaurant surpassed my expectations, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent dining experience. The exceptional service and outstanding dishes are sure to leave a lasting impression on anyone who visits."

Jose's Campfire is my favorite cocktail (tequila infused with lapsang souchong for a smoky flavor). The Joulebox dessert is the perfect blend of sweet, sour, crunchy, and smooth. Sharing 5 dishes between 3 people, or 3 dishes between two (plus the Joulebox for dessert!) usually does us right."

We had just about everything on the menu and were astounded by the brilliant combination of flavors. The smoked tofu was mindblowing and delicious. The grits rich and tasty and the lamb left me hunting for more. The service was impeccable, the decor soothing, and all in all it was one of the best meals I have ever had. Joule is everything I love about seattle--cross cultural, innovative, and fun.I cant wait to go back.And FYI, these chefs just opened a second restaurant in Seattle, Revel. It is just as tasty as Joule but at a more casual affordable price."

For Seattle, American and Asian food is great, but decent and fantastic Latinx food is actually difficult to find in the city. Upon my visit at Cactus in South Lake Union, I ordered a few things. The margaritas and tequila shots were pretty good, but what really threw me off was their ""Camarones Del Diablo"". In Spanish, that means ""Deviled Shrimp"", and I was expecting quite a spicy kick to the flavor. Although it was dim lighting, the plate was served with battered shrimp at the top and coleslaw underneath, with a sweet sauce on the side. I originally thought the coleslaw was white rice until I took a bite. I swear I was eating a combination of southern food (coleslaw) and sweet and sour chicken (shrimp with the sauce), and I was highly disappointed. I help run a restaurant in the Yakima area and our ""Camarones a la Diabla"" will always be superior to this (our plate is served with shrimp drenched in a fiery sauce, rice, and salad). In the end, the staff was professional and timely with our food, as it was a busy Friday night."

The drinks at Cactus are good - not great. Especially the margarita. A good margarita goes a long way in my book, and I'm always disappointed.

Cactus Restaurants,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cactus-restaurants-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=0,Sruthi S.,4,3/15/2023,80,WA,"Cactus Restaurants is a popular chain of Mexican restaurants located in the Seattle area. I have visited a few of their locations and here is my review of the experience.The atmosphere of Cactus Restaurants is vibrant and fun, with a colorful and lively decor. The dining areas are spacious and the seating is comfortable. The staff members are friendly and attentive, providing excellent service throughout the meal.The menu at Cactus Restaurants offers a variety of dishes inspired by Mexican cuisine, with a modern and creative twist. The ingredients are fresh and high-quality, and the dishes are well-prepared and flavorful.One of the standout dishes I tried was the tacos al pastor, which were made with juicy and tender pork, marinated in a flavorful blend of spices and served with fresh salsa and guacamole. The ceviche was also delicious, with fresh seafood and tangy citrus flavors.The drink menu at Cactus Restaurants is also impressive, with a wide selection of tequilas and cocktails. The margaritas are particularly popular and well-made, with a perfect balance of sweetness and tartness.The dessert menu is also worth mentioning, with a variety of sweet treats to choose from. The tres leches cake was particularly delicious, with a moist and creamy texture.Overall, Cactus Restaurants is a great option for those looking for flavorful and modern Mexican cuisine in a fun and lively atmosphere. The quality of the ingredients, the creativity of the dishes, and the attentive service make for a memorable dining experience. I would definitely recommend giving Cactus Restaurants a try if you are in the Seattle area."

The fact that it is smothered in sauce and has guacamole on the side - yum. I will probably order this every time I come here because I know how delicious it is, plus its a good size meal.

I highly recommend the Grilled Jalape�os, which are stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in bacon - delicious! I've taken my family several times, and even my very picky 12 yr old daughter has enjoyed everything she's ordered. For the most part, our service has been great. It can be a little noisy, but that's too be expected from a busy restaurant. My only real complaint about this place is that it has a very corporate vibe, kinda like a large chain."

Cactus Restaurants,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cactus-restaurants-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=60,Justin B.,5,10/19/2013,14,FL,I really love this place. You have to try the corn beef hash in their brunch menu. It's the bees knees.

Cactus Restaurants,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cactus-restaurants-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=60,Kevlyn R.,5,06/06/2013,2,WA,"This is my ABSOLUTE favorite place. I have only been to two, the one on Madison Park and the one on Alki. The one on Madison Park has a really cool atmosphere inside with hanging pepper lanterns. Its one of those places I loved instantly because of the feel. I have been a Cactus regular for almost three years now. I suggest the Alki Cactus on those nice days when you want to be close to the beach and even have a view of the beach!The food is very reasonably priced. My favorites are the seafood enchilada, fish tacos, enchilada verdes, and butternut squach enchillada. By boyfriend also LOVES this place. Their Margaritas are awesome. I took a risk last summer and tried one of their seasonal margaritas (watermelon actually) and it too was AMAZING! I cannot say enough good things about this place. I have gone many times and never have I ever been disappointed by the service or the food. Plus who doesn't love free chips and salsa? THANK YOU CACTUS!!!"

The Chicken Supply,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-chicken-supply-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Matt L.,5,08/10/2024,16,WA,"Here's a 5-star Yelp review for The Chicken Supply in Seattle based on the quality of their chicken:---**Rating:** **Review:**I've had my fair share of fried chicken, but The Chicken Supply in Seattle has taken my love for this comfort food to a whole new level. From the moment I walked in, I knew I was in for something special. The aroma alone had my mouth watering, and let me tell you, the taste did not disappoint!The chicken here is hands down the best I've ever had. Each piece is perfectly crispy on the outside, with a golden, crunchy coating that's just the right thickness. But the real magic happens when you take that first bite--the chicken inside is tender, juicy, and bursting with flavor. It's seasoned to perfection, with a balance of spices that complements the meat without overpowering it.I tried both their classic fried chicken and their spicy option, and both were phenomenal. The spicy chicken has just the right amount of kick, enough to keep things interesting but not so much that it overwhelms the palate. Plus, the portion sizes are generous, so you really get your money's worth of chicken. Beyond the food, the service was top-notch. The staff was friendly, attentive, and clearly passionate about what they do. You can tell they take pride in serving up some of the best chicken in Seattle.I will say we did take the food to go so I'm not sure how it is eating inside. It seems like a small space with a few table but enough for a quick bite. If you're a fried chicken lover, The Chicken Supply is a must-visit. I can't recommend it enough. I'll definitely be back to get my fried chicken fix!"
The Chicken Supply,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-chicken-supply-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Lori S.,5,1/27/2024,6,WA,Absolutely the best fried chicken I have ever had! Great side dishes. Must order the night before after 9PM. Great service.
The Chicken Supply,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-chicken-supply-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Leo F.,5,09/11/2023,10,WA,"Do not sleep in this place. Being a fan of fried chicken, I was surprised at how big the chicken pieces were. I ordered a variety of each. I was on my way home with my order and couldn't wait because it smelled so good! I was the crazy driver who was drinking drumsticks with one hand and driving with the other. The leftover chicken was still crispy! And that they were bomb on the sides and full of flavor too! The garlic rice was wrapped in crispy chicken skin and dipped in a coconut sauce from the greens. Although the meat stick was soggy by the time I got home, it was still very flavorful. One of the best places for chicken in Seattle. Last but not least, the butter mochi cake was chewy and paired so well with the coconut chips that I ate it in one sitting, despite thinking I would have leftovers the next day. . Because it was big enough."
The Chicken Supply,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-chicken-supply-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Tiffany K.,5,9/30/2022,38,CA,"WOW AMAZING. Even if it wasn't gluten free, it's probably the best fried chicken I've ever had. I like both the spicy and the original and recommend the thigh and drumstick. I honestly didn't like the chicken breast stick or the pancit. The pancit had no flavor it was just vegetables and noodles I don't know if it was supposed to come with sauce. The monggo beans and rice is SO GOOD for those who like beans. The butter mochi is the best I've ever had and the cream that comes with it is amazing. The garlic rice is incredible. This is one of those rare places that does everything well even if I didn't like their pancit or chicken breast stick. The potatoes were super good and crips but they were really salty. I'd still get them again."
The Chicken Supply,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-chicken-supply-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Raven M.,5,05/07/2022,1,CA,Best. Chicken. Ever.Thank you Paolo and your awesome crew for an amazing meal!!
The Chicken Supply,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-chicken-supply-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Martin S.,5,10/17/2021,2,WA,"The Chicken Supply just opened for business and I was happy to check out their offerings. My usual fried chicken spot is Heaven Sent in Lake City, but it will be nice to have a place that is closer to my normal work commutes. They are to-go only at the moment and everything traveled well between the time I picked up and when I sat down to eat.Don't forget about the sides when ordering. I can't speak for the owners, but to me it seems as though they are more interested in offering a balanced meal, both in nutrition and flavor profiles, than just selling as much chicken as possible. Of course, with everything purchased piecemeal, that's up to you.The fried chicken had a crisp, spicy (but not too spicy!) and a little sweet exterior, with a moist flavorful interior. Delicious.I tried a few of the sides and my favorite was the Cold Pancit. A light, glass noodle salad who's acidity, especially the bites with cherry tomato, paired perfectly with the heat from the fried chicken.The Coconut Collard Greens were also great, not the standard collard green side that you'll find at fried chicken places. The distinct flavor of collard greens was still there, just muted a bit by the coconut broth and everything else that it cooked in. I didn't do it this time, but it would go great on a pile of rice.I'm also a sucker for pickled vegetables of all types and the Marinated Veggies did not disappoint. A nice medley of veggies, providing different textures to each sweetly marinated bite. Highly recommended."
Zig Zag Cafe,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Jimmy Y.,1,1/20/2017,5,WA,Shit service! The waiter ignored us like we dont exist! And the food was horrible and service is very slow

Zig Zag Cafe,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,E T.,1,8/19/2013,39,WA,Way too expensive for what you get.I didnt go here for happy hour and everything was really overpriced. The waitresses were rude and slow and my mixed drink was really gross. Our table ordered some olives and it took 30 min to get them. Guess I need to come during happy hour but the cocktails are just really bad. Everybody at my table hated their drink.
Zig Zag Cafe,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Bigfoot ..,1,1/24/2012,523,WA,Way too pricey for an average bar.

The new guy making the cocktails behind the counter (I believe his name was Gerardo, or was it Alejandro?) is awesome, and of course Erik and Ben are top notch, as usual. They also know how to treat their customers. I was dropping by on a Friday down in the dumps about my hard disk failing. Came out a little tipsy but VERY much ready to get on with it. Awesome drinks that put you out of whatever mood you're in, and that's hard to do. Usually stuff tastes nasty if you are in a bad mood. Not so here. They know what they are doing."

Zig Zag Cafe,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=20,Royal B.,4,4/21/2016,9,WA,"This is my favourite cocktail area in the city. The setting is fantastic - intimate and amazing but not cheesy, and pretty much anything on the drink menu is good. For the food, I felt the cheese platter proved to be a fine compliment in the event you are going the wine course. In the event you are up for it, purchase the Spanish Coffee and take pleasure in the show."
Zig Zag Cafe,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=20,Mack W.,4,04/11/2016,8,WA,"I went with a buddy, we sat at the pub and described kind of drinks we enjoy to the bartender, and he combined one up for each of us. Truly he followed that with a couple more, on the home. If we did not enjoy one, he'd take it back and start over. I am unsure how much of this had to do with my buddy's flirting skill, but I 'd undoubtedly not write this spot off as 'poor drinks.' This really isn't the place to go with a large group. Go with only one other man, when it is not overly active, sit up at the pub, and really speak with the bartender."
Zig Zag Cafe,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=20,Another G.,4,7/14/2015,102,WA,Not bad at all. Good drinks and ok food for Happy hour. Had a good time and the place was nice. Will definitely go back.

When I told them I'd never heard of it, well, let's just say I was almost ousted from the group. After all the hubub, I was surprised that it wasn't that busy on a Saturday night. There is a really dim, cozy feel to the place. Our bartender was Eric, and his drinks were fantastic. The food is some of the best I've had at a bar, the pizza in particular was surpsingly good.If this place was a little closer to home. I'd go more. But I'll definitely be back!"
Zig Zag Cafe,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=30,Nick G.,4,12/17/2009,161,WA,When other people say that this place is hard to find... they're right. The easiest way to find it is to drive as if you're right in front of Pike Place Market and take the first left which you start going down the hill. You'll see the sky-bridge and you park and get out of your car. Walk to the right and you'll see some steps that go down... it will be on your right.I loved the vibe of the place. Very eclectic atmosphere where young and old will both feel at home. Their drink list is VERY unique and the liquor was too strong for our taste. My girlfriend typically likes fruity cocktail drinks whereas the majority of their drinks were a lot stronger if you know what I mean. We even saw absinthe on the menu and contemplated drinking some but the thought of hallucinating to the State Puff Marshmallow over the Space Needle didn't sound good at the time. Great vibe if you're looking for a chill place to relax in downtown Seattle.
Zig Zag Cafe,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=30,Reiko k.,4,11/05/2009,10,WA,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! The drink menu is truly innovative, Mr. Bartender man has been running this place for ages and you can clearly tell. The service is kind of bland from the server end, but they mind their own business and are fast and efficient. The menu is nice as well...the meat platter was really filling and I love that they serve dinner until 1am!"

The cocktails are amazing, the wine/beer/liquor lists are phenomenal, and the food is great! Sure, it might take a few minutes to get your drink, but it's totally worth the wait - perfection in a glass, every time. Go when Murray is working, and if he has a free moment, pick his brain about whatever booze you think you know a lot about - he'll put you to shame with his knowledge! He's amazing!"

I've never had hummus like this before. I also had a couple other small bites but nothing compared to what the hummus tasted like!Absolutely loved the ambiance. Lighting is romantic. Service was superb! They had a list full of yummy libations!! I had the French 75 (not on the menu) and the RBF. It's definitely a great place to meet up, have a drink and chit chat with some friends! We had an emergency phone call from back home and had to deal with it right away so I didn't have a chance to try anything else. Overall, this was one of my favorite restaurants/bars in Seattle."
Zig Zag Cafe,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=40,Jillian M.,5,11/02/2018,12,WA,"Came here on a Saturday night after dinner for some drinks around 9 pm. It wasn't busy at all and we got seats by the bar immediately; however, it did get pretty crowded by the time we left at 11 pm. It's also a bit confusing to find as it's tucked away in the stairwell; it's easy to misread a sign that directs you to the ""2nd level,"" so naturally you go up a flight of stairs. If you go up the stairs, you'll run into some homeless folks shooting up in a dark walkway.Overall, I'm a fan of their drinks as they were well crafted. The bartenders are really nice and know the right liquor to bitters to juice ratio. The vibe was very intimate with the dim lighting and soft music playing in the background.

By the time it was my turn to order, I was stuck. Our lovely server guided me with just a couple of questions to the perfect off-menu cocktail and it was beyond delicious.

But for me what puts Zig Zag over the top is the high level of service. The staff makes even the ""greenest"" tourist feel like a regular the moment the pony up to the bar. Not in the mood for a fancy cocktail? Erik and co will happily pour you a beer and shot and tell you a raunchy joke. No pretension, no judgments, just a great time every time."

The drinks are very good, amazing even. This is even after the famous bartender that worked here left.

I normally go to a bar and get a beer or a vodka straight up. A trained monkey can serve that stuff, seriously. You go to Zig Zag and you are doing yourself a disservice by not taking advantage of the artists that are standing behind the bar. Shoot they got sterling bar instruments, crystal mixing glasses...it is pretty over the top.My brain did an overload looking at the bottles displayed on the wall so when it was my turn to order, I just told Eric, I believe, to make me something he likes.No clue what to call it buy he threw quite a bit of stuff in there...dak rum, bitters, mint, lime, a splash of somthing and a dash of another. It was really good. Cool atmosphere, like a throwback to a different error. Bartenders all dressed up and just a nice clean atmosphere."

Zig Zag Cafe,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=80,Robert H.,5,06/03/2008,5,WA,"Let's be blunt. If you ever see a book which claims to list the ""Top 10 Bars in the US""... if they don't include the Zig Zag, then they just frankly didn't do their research. Period. End Of Story.For me, the Zig Zag hits it out of the park on a variety of levels. To begin with, they are able to make the best cocktails you have ever had (more about that later). Their food is casual, relaxed, and unpretensious. I've had everything on their menu, and aside from the fact they leave the tails on the shrimp in their gumbo (pet peeve), I love everything. And they have such a wonderful bunch of regulars that it often feels like ""Cheers"" (everybody knows your name) when I drop in.On the cocktails...Reading through all of the reviews here, I see a few folk who appear to be scratching their heads when the rest of us are going on and on about the cocktails. It is a puzzlement.The Zig Zag takes pride in their cocktails, and for good reason. Their ""house list"" is one which shows off their craft at providing wonderfully exciting drinks that illustrate the culinary potential of the cocktail. I think the problem that many have, is that some of these drinks are perhaps not quite as ""approachable"" to the uninitiated.For any of you who have had a not-as-good-as-youd-like experience at the Zig Zag, here are two suggestions:Suggestion 1:Drop in from Tues-Fri, and early on, say between 5 and 7. Sit AT THE BAR. And don't look at the cocktail menu. Tell the bartender (Murray), what drink you normally like to drink, and what bar you think makes your favorite, and ask him if he has a recommendation. The drink you get will show you why we all rave about the Zig Zag.Suggestion 2. Make it a point to go there with me.-Robert ""DrinkBoy"" Hess"
Zig Zag Cafe,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/zig-zag-cafe-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=80,Sandy B.,5,3/28/2008,15,WA,"Murray is a wizard behind the bar. This is my top recommendation for delicious, sophisticated cocktails and just a great place to go to unwind and for conversation. It's tucked away in the hillclimb of the Pike Pace Market and it makes you feel like you're part of a private club since not everyone is in the ""know"" because it's off the beaten path.They have the biggest Whiskey and Brandy selection that I've found since I moved to Seattle. The menu is simple with sandwiches, salads and light snacks but they are really tasty."

The perfect spot for a date night,... pretty much any night. Everything about 84 Yesler is so well thought out, and perfect it executed. We ordered from the Chef's tasting menu, and added a wine pairing. Chef Sean and the sommelier Mike crafted a flawless 5-course meal that was built around our personal likes and dislikes. They seem to specialize in unexpected twists to their dishes that are creative without being too over the top- perfectly complimenting the dish without or distracting you from it. Their handmade pastas are perfect in every way, while fresh fish (seared fatty tuna!) and meats (lamb mushroom reduction!) were sublime. Service is attentive without being overbearing, and at just the right pace. This his our new regular go-to!"

If they would have told us from the beginning 'take-out only' I would have been fine, but kicking us out 5 minutes after sitting down is UNACCEPTABLE!!!"

EVERYTHING IS OVER-PRICED, to an INSANE degree. skip it."
Rocco's,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Sonja S.,2,1/22/2024,52,CA,"I wanted to like it but it just wasn't that good. A cheese pizza for $50 should be fire but this wasn't. It was just okay, nothing special and the sauce was trash. I know great pizza and this wasn't that. I feel ripped off. I'd pass and go somewhere else if I were you."
Rocco's,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Nicole P.,2,10/02/2019,16,WA,Pizza took literally forever and they were not that busy. The service was extremely slow as well. Pizza when it came was average.
Rocco's,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Aaron W.,2,5/20/2017,5,WA,Ordered a couple slices of pizza and the pizza was delicious but the service was terrible.
Rocco's,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,kunjal p.,3,6/17/2022,54,CA,The pizza crust was good. Pickles were overpriced salad was good the ambience was good
Rocco's,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Anthony L.,3,08/11/2019,44,CA,"Quality pizza, but super long wait time during lunch time did not leave a great first impression on me.The good: the servers and staffs were extremely friendly and polite. We were seated at a table first, when 2 minutes later the waiter realized the table was reserved already. He apologized and moved us to a different table, which was:  1. not a big deal at all  2. 10 feet away  3. a better table anywayNevertheless, he was super apologetic and gave us a $10 discount on our bill.The low: I came here with my co-workers for lunch, and we definitely did not expect the long wait time for food. After placing our order, we waited for at least 45 minutes before the food was ready. We didn't order anything special/customized either...my order was actually ""pizza by the slice"", which they literally just needed to grab from the counter and heat up. We did not leave with an excellent mood as we were hoping to grab a quick lunch and head back to work.The personal take: now onto the pizza itself. Personally, I'm a big NY style thin-slice pizza fan. I was excited when I saw that they have pizza by the slice option, which was not a common in the west coast. I was, however, disappointed after the long wait, as well as the food itself. It was definitely tasty, with a lot of ingredients, but unfortunately I set my expectation too high and was craving for the traditional NYC thin-slice style, and the pizza at Rocco's definitely wasn't that.Overall an average pizza place for me. I see that it got a lot of 5-star reviews, but for me, I prefer the thin-slice style, as well as a much faster serving pace."
Rocco's,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Anthony N.,3,8/19/2018,112,CO,"Went there for lunch, fast service, good pizza and a friendly atmosphere."

Rocco's,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,Shameika S.,4,06/03/2019,581,TX,My friend and I were in Seattle for the weekend and just completed a little food tour at Pike Place market. After walking around Park Place and buying goods from other consumers wanted to go back home. But we were still hungry. We asked around about who had great pizza and everyone said Rocco's. When entering Rocco's I saw the pizza that everyone was talking about. There were so many different choices to choose from. I ended up getting a veggie pizza and a classic pepperoni. Our waiter was very nice and funny and the vibes in the music were A1. I think the best part that surprised me was at the drink menu was actually located inside of the cat in the hat book. Friendly service and great pizza. [Review 79 for 2019. Review 521 overall]

Looking inside there didn't appear to be air conditioning and the pizzas looked tiny. We decided to bail and find somewhere else.Looking on Yelp there was another place a few blocks away so off we went to have a look. What a great quirky pizza place! Huge pies, excellent attentive service, a great atmosphere and a fully loaded bar.Highly recommended if you have a craving for pizza in Seattle!"

Although this is a temple of fine dining, the service was friendly and unpretentious. Food was perfectly prepared, and deliciously flavorful. (I had a Chilled Peekytoe Crab Salad, Poached Halibut with ""Black Truffle Pot-au-Feu"" and Hazelnut Marshmallow desert.) We were seated in the corner in a curved banquette that gave us both a great ""people watching"" view of the beautiful dining room. We are both foodies who live in San Francisco, so we had high expectations, which were fully"

But this place is quite tasty. like the pizza, but the prices are a tad bit expensive. 40$ for a large pie is a a lot."
Rocco's,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Evangeline R.,4,09/11/2012,11,WA,Great service. Great decor. Decent pizza. Glad to have this in Belltown.
Rocco's,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Laura L.,4,09/06/2012,12,NY,"I was visiting my daughter who lives in Seattle last week.I desperately needed to find a place that serves good pizza and tried out Rocco's after perusing restaurants on Yelp. Now let me be clear on this...I would give Rocco's 5 stars but I noticed on Yelp that a five star rating gets kicked to the ""filtered"" catagory so I opted for4 stars to be safe. I actually read the filtered reviews and decided to give this place a try and I am glad I did. I too am from New York so I have high standards for pizza. Rocco's did not disappoint. The crust was thin and crisp and the sauce had a fresh, home made taste. I dont know why previous reviewers were so negative about this place. The decor is very unique and sophisticated ..not a typical pizza joint atmosphere. I cant review the shrub drinks since I stuck with wine, but the bar is fully equipped and the drinks I saw being made looked wonderful. My wine was a generous amount for the price and paired well with the salad I ordered. The greens were crisp and flavorful and the salad was lightly dressed as I had requested. The service was top notch and the wait staff was able to answer all my questions regarding the menu. I find this commendable for a restaurant that has only recently opened. A lot of the reviews on Yelp seem to love to nit pick a business (perhaps a result of our reality TV mind set) and I have read unfair reviews of restaurants and businesses that I frequent in my hometown of Saratoga, NY. After having excellent food and service in a classy, sophisticated restaurant like Rocco's I feel that people should be presented with a more accurate appraisal of the place. The negative reviews sound like they are written by competitors. I am glad I read the filtered reviews, otherwise I would not have chosen to dine at Rocco's. Incidentally, my daughter and her friends agree with my assessment since they accompanied me during dinner. Read the filtered reviews, people, and maybe you will agree that the publishedreviews sure seem to be prejudiced and perhaps inaccurate."
Rocco's,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Caroline X.,5,04/08/2024,37,WA,"This pizza place is one of my favorite spots in town, just a 5-minute walk from Pike Place Market. Whenever I'm craving a delicious slice, this place is my go-to. The take-out option is super convenient, and they're always speedy with my order. And let's talk about their Rocco's specialty pizza, it's absolutely delicious and innovative. On my last visit, I ordered the Stacey & Tina's night out, and the crust was the perfect balance between crispy and fluffy, while the sauce tied everything together with its toppings. Plus, the half size is just right for sharing between two people.The atmosphere here is great too. The fun part about this place is that they put the drink menu in a kids' book cover. It's quirky, fun, and totally sets the mood. The staff are friendly, helpful, and attentive. I'll definitely be coming back for more pizzas and to explore their specialty options."

Despite the Friday night frenzy, we snagged seats at the bar in just 20 minutes. The meatballs were a total game-changer - seriously, they were the highlight of the night. And don't even get me started on the pizza - absolute perfection in every bite. Plus, the ambiance was eclectic and made for a perfect date night vibe. No doubt, next time we hit up Seattle, Rocco's is our first stop!"

We're already planning our next visit to explore more of their tasty pizzas!"
Rocco's,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/roccos-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Emmanuel T.,5,11/22/2023,187,WA,"I visited Rocco's in Seattle with five colleagues for lunch, and it was a delightful experience! We started with their Meatballs Al Forno and Brussel Sprouts, followed by two mouth-watering pizzas: ""Three Little Piggies"" and ""Stacey and Tina's Night Out."" The meatballs, with their spicy kick, was a highlight for me, adding a zing to our meal.Both pizzas were delicious, but next time, I'll try and request larger slices to enjoy them NY-style. That minor point aside, everything about our visit was top-notch. Our server deserves a special mention for their quick, attentive, and friendly service, enhancing our overall experience. The decor and ambiance stood out, the place also felt so much larger inside than I expected. Great place for any get together, hanging out with friends, or a date night.Highly recommend for anyone looking for an outstanding dining experience in Seattle!"

Pizza was delicious- veggie, pepperoni and meat slice. I would recommend all of them. All of the salads look great but the arugula one was bomb. Tequila cocktails were a touch bland and not spicy like their menu description. The bar is fully stocked with tons of options though, great selection. Waiter was nice. I would def come back."

I've just been conditioned to expect that. This is where Paul, the bartender, comes into play. He crafted a handful of drinks for my wife and I based off a few questions. These were some of the best cocktails I've had in some time. So much so that after the Highly Suspect show, we went back to continue down the cocktail experimentation!"

There is a tin ceiling which I love and rarely see out here (I'm an East coast transplant), cool booths, and some private tables and window seating. Everything was super unique and you can tell they put some love and thought into this place. I had a slice this afternoon and it was super delish and reasonably priced! Dare I say, I may have found my favorite pizza place in Seattle ;) I will definitely be back!"

Cafe Hagen,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/caf%C3%A9-hagen-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Jen L.,2,01/02/2024,12,WA,"I always love visiting Cafe Hagen on my weekends for a morning coffee or brunch with friends. The decor is a perfect mix of dark minimalist and modern, with greenery sprinkled all across the cafe to make it feel cozy. The line to wait for coffee is always pretty long on weekend mornings between 10am to noon and extends to the outside patio, so be prepared to wait if you're planning on going around that time; or bring a friend to help make the time go by faster. I do wish there was more seating at this cafe, especially in the winter when outdoor seating is limited. Trying to snag a seat is always a difficult task here.The menu at Cafe Hagen is just as eclectic as the decor. I was impressed with the range of offerings, from classic breakfast items like pancakes and eggs to more adventurous options like the avocado toast with smoked salmon. I opted for the latter, and it was absolutely delicious. The combination of flavors was unexpected but worked so well together. The staff is not particularly friendly compared to most local coffee shops, so don't be offended if they're a bit curt or try to rush you. Beyond that, Cafe Hagen is the kind of place where you can go to work or study, catch up with friends, or just sit and people-watch.The pastries at Cafe Hagen are always a favorite. They are truly works of art, with intricate designs and flavors that will leave you in awe. I especially love their pear danish and seed snapper. Overall, I recommend Cafe Hagen to anyone looking for a one-of-a-kind cafe experience. It's a great post-workout coffee spot or a place to get work done and catch up with friends."

The highlight of my visit was the waffles with fresh fruits - they were delicious and had the perfect balance of sweetness and freshness.But that's not all - the rosemary latte was also a standout item on the menu. The fragrant aroma of rosemary perfectly complemented the rich espresso, making for a truly unique and enjoyable coffee experience.The only downside was that the cafe was quite crowded, especially during the cold weather. However, the cozy atmosphere and friendly service more than made up for it. Plus, the bustling vibe added to the excitement and energy of the place.Overall, I highly recommend Cafe Hagen to anyone looking for a great breakfast or brunch spot in South Lake Union.

The flavors of the pickled veggies and arugula went really well together too. The chai latte was okay--a little too sweet and not enough spice. This place become my favourt one."

Yummy food - the menu is in flux, but they said it's all made in-house, so miles better than mass-produced Starbucks pastries. Outstanding coffee - it's on the lighter side and sweeter side, but their espresso is so tasty it's surprising they're not blowing up the coffee scene. Great vibe - yes the music can get loud, but you cannot beat those big windows and all the plants and clean design."

Homer,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/homer-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Rodney X B.,1,10/18/2019,2,WA,The wait at this place is outrageous. They put you on a list then call on you for your table to be ready and you get there and it's not ready. Their servers and hosts act like we don't exist and ignores us and tests our patience. This place is riddled with white people of priveledge. Way to make you feel inclusive. I would not recomend this place ever again.
Homer,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/homer-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Amy N.,2,2/16/2020,7,WA,The host failed to tell us when we put our name in that we had 5 minutes to get back once we received a text. When we arrived after 7 minutes we were told we were too late and 3 tables that had been texted in that 2 minute period walked in after us and got seated before us. We were now looking at a 20 minute wait. Host fail. Set expectations appropriately moving forward for a better overall experience for your customers.
Homer,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/homer-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Diane J.,4,11/02/2023,29,WA,"This restaurant is ideally in between casual and fine dining. The dishes come in small portions for sharing and all the food that we tried was absolutely delicious. A must try hidden Seattle spot. Beginning with the neighborhood it was located in, the local, home like vibe, we felt invited and welcomed. We opted to dine at a table to get the full experience. Service was excellent and friendly.They have a good variety of options to share. The food is Mediterranean inspired. Ordered hummus plate, apple salad, meatballs, lamb ribs and basmati cake. Each savory dish's flavors played off of each other so perfectly.There are plenty of vegetarian options. If you are visiting for the first time, do take the kitchen counter seat. You'll have a nice view of how the food was made."
Homer,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/homer-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Harley H.,4,10/17/2020,9,WA,Tried Homer at the start of quarantine and had an AMAZING experience. Seriously some of the best food I'd had in a while. I'm taking a star off because they changed the menu and don't have many vegetarian options and no lamb pita that I loved. I will be back and I'm excited to try more dishes once the menu is expanded but it seems a tad limited now which is understandable.

Homer,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/homer-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Matthew M.,5,8/17/2024,39,CA,"Last night, we had the pleasure of dining at Restaurant Homer in Seattle, and it was an experience that exceeded every expectation. From start to finish, each dish was a masterclass in flavor, texture, and presentation.We began with the hummus, a deceptively simple starter that showcased the depth of flavor achieved by the combination of chickpeas and cumin. The hummus was creamy, rich, and perfectly balanced with just the right amount of spice, setting the tone for the evening.For our larger plates, we indulged in the grilled pork with caramelized cashew, cherry mostarda, fennel, and dandelion. The pork was tender and succulent, with the cherry mostarda adding a sweet-tart contrast that elevated the dish to new heights. The caramelized cashew provided a delightful crunch, while the fennel and dandelion brought freshness and complexity to the plate. The wahl grazing lamb was equally impressive, paired with smoked tomato kibbeh naya, sungolds, nectarines, and mustard seeds. The lamb was cooked to perfection, and the accompaniments created a symphony of flavors that danced on the palate.We complemented these larger plates with two smaller but equally memorable dishes. The smoked potatoes with Tunisian pepper jam, anise seeds, and walnut emulsion were a standout, offering a smoky richness that was beautifully countered by the spicy-sweet jam and nutty walnut. The grilled summer squash was another revelation, served with corn custard, pickled grapes, crunchy sesame, and basil. Each bite was a harmonious blend of sweet, tangy, and savory, with the pickled grapes adding an unexpected yet delightful zing.To finish, we indulged in the burnt cheesecake with rhubarb compote and black lime, paired with hibiscus ice cream. The cheesecake was the perfect balance of creamy and slightly tart, with the rhubarb compote adding a fruity brightness. The hibiscus ice cream was a refreshing and floral end to the meal, tying everything together beautifully.Overall, our dinner at Homer was nothing short of extraordinary. Every dish was thoughtfully crafted, with each ingredient playing its part in a perfectly orchestrated dining experience. I can't recommend Homer enough--it's a true gem in Seattle's culinary scene."

Dishes like the pickes and the fruit achar bring bright spicy flavors but then the dal and other mains are complex smoky and comfy flavors all without being too heavy.

But ever since they switched to an all-you-can-eat model, it's gone downhill. The restaurant itself is sleek, modern, and has a nice ambiance--great lighting, stylish decor, and an overall upscale feel. It's a spot that looks like it should offer a high-quality dining experience. Unfortunately, the food and service don't quite match the setting.The biggest issue is the two-tier AYCE menu. Every time I visit, most of the premium items on the top tier are ""out of stock,"" making the upgrade feel like a waste of money. The 90-minute limit wouldn't be a problem if you could actually order what you wanted, but with so many unavailable items, it just feels frustrating.While the atmosphere is enjoyable, the inconsistency in food quality and availability make it hard to justify coming back. At this point, it's just not worth it when there are better options elsewhere."

Niku Niku Japanese Barbecue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/niku-niku-japanese-barbecue-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Veronica L.,4,11/01/2024,67,WA,"I recently visited this AYCE Korean BBQ spot priced at around $35-40 per person. While it's a decent deal for AYCE, the meat selection is fairly limited. The regular cuts, while satisfactory, are often quite chewy, so if you're looking for higher quality, the upgrade option is definitely the way to go. That said, even the upgraded meats are just okay--they don't quite stand out compared to other places in this price range. Nice open place with good hood system so it doesn't feel too smoky.I miss the old Niku, where you could order a la carte with better quality meats and more personalized service. Now, it feels more like any other AYCE KBBQ place, which has its appeal for the price, but lacks the uniqueness and service it once had. Overall, it's a fair value if you're craving AYCE KBBQ on a budget, but it doesn't offer the standout experience it used to."

Regrettably, I had to discard both of the brisket wonton soups I ordered due to their unpleasant odor and taste.

Easy on the meat and the broth was fine but not excellent with lots of flavor, just a broth, kinda flavorless. We got also a pork dish, same here, easy on the meat with a boatload of rice, great flavor. Water seems to be unfiltered, with some chlorine flavor.

The beef brisket, in particular, was a standout--tender, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. Each bowl of noodle soup was rich and satisfying, with a perfect balance of textures and flavors. The Chinese Donuts, while not crispy on the outside as I had hoped, still tasted good and was a great addition to our soups. The Chinese Broccoli was cooked perfectly, but it was dressed with a bit too much oyster sauce, making it a bit overly salty.Service was friendly and fast, adding to the overall great experience.

Be prepared for a bit of a wait though, because it's so popular. The restaurant itself isn't huge, and the tables are cozy-close, adding to its charm.The food it's absolutely fantastic! I ordered both the No.17 Squid Ball & beef brisket noodle soup and the No.9 Wonton & beef brisket noodle soup. Both dishes were amazing, just depending on your topping preference. Personally, I'd highly recommend giving the wonton a try; the filling is incredibly flavorful and just the right size.

Mike's Noodle House,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/mikes-noodle-house-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Raymond W.,5,1/21/2014,50,NY,"We stumbled across this hidden gem on our family vacation to the PNW. Our plan to explore the ID has led us to a parking spot just outside of Mike's. My mom stepped outside of the car, she immediately started sniffing the air like a wolf in the frozen forest and pointed to the door...""We must go in!"". The aroma being described is the distinctive smell of yellow chives mixed with chicken broth. A smell commonly found near wonton noodle shops in Hong Kong, but it was a smell no where to be found on the east coast. It was 3 pm, the place was fairly empty, and I had my doubts.  My mom went ahead and ordered the wonton noodle soup, and a congee. My sister had a mixture of wonton and dumplings, and I had the beef brisket noodles. This was just 2 hours after stuffing ourselves at Pike Place Market. The moment my mom took her first bite, I can see her smile from ear to ear. I then had a taste of the wonton and I understood why. The wonton were made true to HK style with fresh shrimp and a bit of pork, unlike other noodles shops where the pork plays more of a dominant role. More importantly, the folks at Mike's really took the time to create the perfect broth. When I looked through the glass window to the kitchen, there were chicken bones piled high to the ceiling, all were purely used to create the broth alone. It was the best bowl of wonton noodle soup I've ever had in the US, and in fact outside of Hong Kong. We stopped by Mike's one more time on the day of our departure before heading back to the east coast.I recently visited Seattle again for a weekend in October, and I ended up eating at this place twice on my trip. This time around, I went at lunch time, there was actually a line waiting to get in. I took my korean friends whom lived in Seattle for the past 10 years to Mike's and they were surprised how they have never heard of this place before, but I think they are hooked now. If you love noodle soups and know what a bowl of true HK-style wonton noodle soup should taste like, you must stop try Mike's."

I have a good experience every time with the exception of once where I felt that there was a smell coming from the won ton soup which I requested them to exchange for me. They did not hesitate to help me change it and did not give me any attitude at all. I was very surprised by the great service since some places I've been to are not so nice when customers complain.Good times all in all.

Harbor City Restaurant,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Chris P.,1,12/29/2016,7,WA,"The worst chinese food I have ever had. I ordered for delivery. I ordered 4 dishes most of which had green or white onions in huge chunks that were barely even cooked. The green onions were literally cut into 3"" chunks. They were very nearly raw. The broccoli beef had chinese broccoli not regular broccoli which I had never seen for that dish, and the menu didn't state that it was made with chinese broccoli. The bok choy with garlic sauce had plenty of bok choy....but mostly the white bitter part and very few greens. The beef was tough and chewy not tender like it should be and flavorless. The mongolian beef was sweet which it isnt supposed to be and minty which is just weird. The fried rice was mushy. Seriously just crap food. I didnt even finish it. Just tossed the rest. It seems that the in house eating is great according to the reviews so I'm really puzzled why delivery was so bad. But for some reason, delivery food quality in this case was ridiculously bad. Who ever made this wasn't even pretending to know how to use a wok. I ordered this through amazon restaurants. I'll be contacting them about a refund. Yeah, it was THAT bad."

Delivery time was 39 minutes, which was awesome.  The Shrimp and Vegetable Egg Rolls were awesome, packed full of tender shrimp. The Potstickers were large, and the filling, though unidentifiable, tasted pretty good. The Almond Fried Chicken was overcooked, chewy, and tough. The sauce was not a normal thick sauce for Almond Fried Chicken... not sure what it was. But the chicken tasted OLD, and was inedible. I won't even take it home to try to feed it to my cats, it's THAT bad. Since Almond Fried Chicken is the ONLY main dish I ever order from a Chinese/Cantonese restaurant, I will most likely never order from Harbor City Restaurant again... there was really no excuse for sending out such bad chicken to a delivery customer. Ten bucks down the drain on that one!"

Service was prompt and on point, though we waitred to be seated, we didn't wait long.The place was filled with crowd when we pop in but it was fine. Maybe the downside was the food, I was looking forward for a delicious meal but ended up having that.3 stars."

Harbor City Restaurant,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,B.B W.,3,11/08/2016,30,WA,Always a nice surprise to find places like this in Chinatown. Most are touristy and food subpar. I didn't realize how long HCR has been around until we came in and read it on their menu. Definitely an institution after 100 years!  Everything we ordered was good. Not too greasy and salty. My ultimate favorite is the raw fish salad. So much happening in my mouth with so many flavors coming out. Packed full of flavor and textures. For an Irish guy Im happy.
Harbor City Restaurant,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Chat P.,3,8/28/2016,22,WA,The food is possibly 4 stars. Service is 2 stars. Slowness is 5 stars. And I'm a super star.

While Jade Garden is a consistent favorite, this little younger sister across the street has become a crowd pleaser in recent years. Long wait on weekend so walk around after you put your name in and you should be set in 25-30 minutes.We'll come back!"

Harbor City Restaurant,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,Pam X.,4,12/03/2018,4,WA,"Harbor City is a staple in Seattle's Chinatown. It opens early and stays open late. I decided to review Harbor City because early mornings in Seattle's Chinatown can be difficult to find good Chinese food. Harbor City offers Dim Sum each day so one can always go here. But the good thing about Harbor City is you can order off the menu as well as select Dim Sum from the carts. I like to order one or two vegetables from the menu to complement the Dim Sum. The two I like to order are Chinese Broccoli and Bok Choy. Of course this is a lot of food so going as a group of four or more is best.I had 4 friends from Spokane, WA in town and took them to Harbor City. Not having good quality Chinese in Spokane, they really had a good time. I got funny looks when order vegetables, but in no time both dishes were gone. Between the Dim Sum and Vegetables, everyone had a good experience. The food as usual is always good."
Harbor City Restaurant,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,Jessica P.,4,11/30/2018,1,CA,"We were on vacation with my family and definitely hungry looking for a great place to indulge. This certainly hit the spot. Delicious dimsum choices, menus made to order esp the peking pork chop. A must try."
Harbor City Restaurant,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Luke N.,4,1/16/2018,10,WA,"I love trying out new restaurants, and it was a fun place for my friends and I to go. We enjoyed the food very much. I loved the combination of traditional Korean flavors with a modern twist - unique!It was sort of 'Korean tapas', but it was a bit expensive for the amount of food you get. So tasty though! The service was good and everyone was friendly, so no complaints there.I know they're new, but I do wish they had a happy hour. I work downtown, and would love to come by more frequently, but unless a happy hour appears, this place will be for special evenings."
Harbor City Restaurant,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Francis K.,4,9/29/2017,16,WA,Very good. Waitress misunderstood and place the wrong order for me.
Harbor City Restaurant,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Roy F.,4,2/20/2017,10,WA,"I had a brunch here on Saturday with my friends. My friends were telling me before that this was the best place to have Dim Sum in town, and my expectation was set very high. When we got there around 11:30, it was already fully packed. ""shumai"" was really good, and also I liked stir fried Chinese broccoli. To be frank, food itself is maybe 3.5 stars but including serving speed and ""price"", I would say 4 stars. To me, it is nonsense to expect ""great five star"" service from $ or $$ restaurants. If someone wants to get Five-star service, they should go ""high price"" restaurants. From their price, I think 4 - 4.5 starts should be reasonable with me. Again, it is a great place to enjoy dim sum and also ""China town""! You must expect long wait if you go for brunch."
Harbor City Restaurant,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Dennis M.,4,12/06/2016,446,NJ,Yummy. It's the real deal
Harbor City Restaurant,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Nathan J.,4,7/23/2016,5,WA,"The kung pao chicken was very good, not too spicy or salty. The onion ginger chicken was also very tasty. Chicken very tender and good portions. Chinese broccoli was very good as was the soft tofu and mushroom and the charsiu bbq honey chicken was good. The only thing that lacked was the taro beef dim sum. Not much flavor or taro color! Service is as expected for only one guy serving the whole restaurant, but our food was delivered quickly. I would order their normal food but stay away from the dim sum."
Harbor City Restaurant,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Brian C.,4,3/23/2016,45,WA,"Classic Chinatown restaurant, specializing in roasted meats.

Carts & Trays of wonderful dumplings come around quite often. Don't forget to order the crispy green beans with garlic chips as they are a special item and don't come around regularly like the dumplings do. They serve dim sum anytime but when it's not busy you have to order from the dim sum menu.

Not great, but not terrible. The trick though, is learning some of the secret dishes this place has to offer: Try ordering a ""century egg steamed fish rice-noodle roll"" (or ""pay dan yu pien cheung fun"" in Cantonese), or a ""spareribs and chicken feet steamed rice-noodle roll"" (""pai gwut fong jow cheung fun""). I promise these will blow you away. One of the best kept secrets in Chinatown."

I've never been during any other time but the dim sum is really great. Best I've had in seattle. Gotta go if you haven't been.
Harbor City Restaurant,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/harbor-city-restaurant-seattle?not_recommended_start=90,Peter C.,5,05/02/2013,23,WI,"For dim sum, I've tried Jade Garden, House of Hong, and a few others in addition to Harbor City. I see the same dishes at most places, but there are certainly differences in preparation, quality and freshness. Harbor City is the best. Their shrimp cakes in particular are excellent. Many dishes, like the pork bun, seem to have a glaze of honey or syrup on them and are sweeter than at most places. The staff are good about filling water glasses and are very willing to make things upon request (my daughter loves pork pot stickers, which aren't usually on the carts). The restaurant is small and gets crowded on Sunday mornings."

Their portions are ample, the variety and preparation of the items excellent, the staff attentive. The prices are also very reasonable, you'll be pleasently surprised when you receive the bill.A Wide selections of teas are available to those who ask. My favorite item is the Lo Mai Gai, but the Taro nest is better than I've had at other local Dim Sum restaurants."

Quite cozy but, a fun atmosphere and a bit loud. Quite a few small twists on BBQ dishes without going too far out of the box. The cornbread in particular was outrageously good! The cocktails were creative and excellent? They were a great selection and text... even for a power drinker. The service was great and suited our tempo. We'll be back."

Radiator Whiskey,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/radiator-whiskey-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Angela B.,4,10/17/2023,125,CA,"Radiator Whiskey, located on the 2nd floor above Pike Place Market and accessed through an elevator, offers a hearty dining experience that earns it a solid 4/5 rating. Despite the crowded seating and full bar area, the ambiance is lively, bordering on loud, making it a bit challenging to hold a conversation. The portions here are generous, catering to those with hearty appetites or groups looking to share.The loaded tater tots is a great, easily shareable appetizer for 3-4 people. The toppings were generous especially the pulled pork. The smoked then fried chicken dish, accompanied by a substantial serving of Mac n cheese, and cornbread, comes with two sizable pieces of chicken and is perfect for those with larger appetites or can be shared by two, especially if paired with an appetizer or side dish.The fried pork shank, while tender, lacked balance. The collared greens were overly salty, highlighting the need for some form of carbs, like bread or potatoes, to counterbalance the dish's fattiness and saltiness. I see in the pictures that this was served with some form of pasta in the past, not sure what changed. We didn't try a drink here but will plan on doing so next time. Solid option for dining near downtown if you account for the noise level and lack of space."
Radiator Whiskey,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/radiator-whiskey-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Rick J.,4,06/05/2023,17,WA,Good food and good drinks. Highly recommended.

The menu items are original and unlike anything I've seen elsewhere, but everything was super yummy and reminded me a little strange comfort food. I'd never purchase chicken livers, but the fried chicken livers with franks hot sauce were astounding. As was the tater tots with gravy and fried egg, as well as the pork cheek stew with Fritos. (The Fritos actually make the dish). Next time, I'm purchasing the pig face, not only because it seemed tasty, but the left overs came wrapped in a foil swan. Not only is the food great, the staff were wonderful as well as the atmosphere is cosy and laid back."

The food is good-- the drinks are amazing. The only thing that was kind of weird is that we had to stand at a stand up table and eat our lunch. Wasn't a huge fan of that. They should reconfigure their seating somehow.
Radiator Whiskey,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/radiator-whiskey-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Allie Y.,4,01/05/2016,535,CA,"My boyfriend and I came here for NYE dinner. We called earlier in the day and they told us that reservations were full and we could dine here if we walk in and wait. We really wanted to try this place out since my boyfriend loves whiskey and the food here looks yummy. Upon arrival, we were surprised that the restaurant was only 3/4 full and was seated promptly. It made me wonder how many customers they turned down on the phone if they told everyone who called that day that reservations were full. It was a difficult for us to find this place but it is located between the Pike Place sign and the Starbucks across the street. You take the elevator up a few floors and walk down hallway to get here. It felt like walking in an office building which I never experienced or imagined a bar to be at.Service: We were seated promptly at a table that fits 4. After another party of two left, the waitress asked if we would like to move to the other table for two next to the window with a view. I thought this was nice of them and the view outside our window was the busy 1st Ave and of course, the strip club across the street. Food: I ordered a Turkey Drum Confit and my boyfriend ordered Fried pork shank. The Turkey Drum confit was big and cooked very well and was not dry at all! The sauce that was served with it was super delicious as well as the potatoes it came with. It was the perfect portion. The fried pork shank was juicy and meaty. Ambiance: I liked the tiny barrels around the restaurant. With the dim lighting and individual candle lighted up on each table, it gives a very classy feel.Overall, I would definitely come back. The food, drinks, and service is outstanding."

The food was good, the service was great, and the drinks? Excellent! You have to like beer, bourbon, or whiskey--they really know how to pour here. You have to appreciate real rock music. The music selection was spot-on and added to the laid-back vibe. Lastly, you have to be real. If you're expecting some high-end, pretentious dining experience, this isn't the place for you.If you're looking for a casual spot with good BBQ, great drinks, and an awesome playlist, this place is worth checking out."

We didn't try the food since we already ate, but I heard it's good too. Not sure about parking, we walked from pier 55, took us about 10 mins. Oh, and don't miss it - the bar is upstairs and the sign isn't very obvious. But seriously, the service is top-notch! The vibe was really chill on a Wednesday night. If you're into whiskey, you should definitely check this place out."

On my visit, I opted for the smoked and fried chicken, complemented by mac and cheese. The experience was truly delightful. Although chicken isn't usually my go-to choice, this particular dish proved to be an excellent decision! We were served by Amanda, who was not only personable but also quite well-versed in her field."
Radiator Whiskey,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/radiator-whiskey-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Brian R.,5,11/03/2022,9,WA,"It was absolutely great, unusual for a pike place restaurant which usually cater to tourists. Do not skip the pork belly appetizer or the cornbread! I had the brisket and it was lick the plate delicious."

Never too overpacked but usually a pretty energetic and lively crowd. A good after-spot once you hit up Matt's in the Market too."
Radiator Whiskey,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/radiator-whiskey-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Dana H.,5,4/30/2020,10,CA,"Friendly staff who actually knew about the bourbon they were selling. If you like whiskey,their chicken is out of this world, and it's the first place I've heard of getting deep fried beef lips... I know it sounds weird, but they were delicious!

Radiator Whiskey,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/radiator-whiskey-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Hanna B.,5,05/09/2019,6,NC,"Crowded bar setting with chic gourmet eats.The place was a little difficult to find, but well worth the search. We started with the watermelon tomato salad. This fresh and tasty dish was not a dish I was expecting to find this kind of bar scene, but it got me excited for the rest of the meal. For mains, I ordered the fried pork shank. I consider most things that are fried to be good, but this was excellent. The layers of texture below the crispy fried crust to the tender meat made this dish a delicious adventure to eat. Great place to wind down after tiring yourself out from site-seeing around Pike/Pine!"
Radiator Whiskey,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/radiator-whiskey-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Emily M.,5,12/03/2018,4,WA,Great location to start off . It has a great happy hour . Would recommend this place to people visiting the area

I made reservations for a party of 4 two hours before opening and they were able to fit us in! The roasted half chicken was so delicious - it had a nice smoky flavor with a sweet glaze. The potato salad along with the shaved salad consisting of zucchini, yellow squash, and celery paired really nicely with the chicken. The picture doesn't do the dish justice - it was a generous portion but I managed to finish it all!"

Located upstairs on the 3rd floor it felt pretty hot & stuffy but we quickly got over that with some YUMMY drinks. Staff was extremely friendly and the open kitchen allowed us to watch the chef work his magic! Before you order take a look at their specials. We had the Debris Sandwich and the fried pork shank. Then topped it all off with the pecan pie with rum ice cream. We left stuffed!

We were looking for a laid back, chill environment and radiator whiskey is just the place. It was a bit crowded on a Friday night. Took us about half an hour to get a spot. My friends and I just wanted to chill and talk about life so we ordered a bunch of cocktails and drank it. Wasn't sure what it was but I believe it was probably tequila or vodka.After being there for a bit over an hour, we got hungry and ordered tater tots. It definitely hit the spot. It came wit a fried egg on the top and wow what a finishing touch.If you want to go here to drink, snack and eat light or full food. This is the perfect place with the perfect ambience. Could get extremely busy though."

Lots of creative interior, keeping with the Pike's Place vibe. Our table ordered a few different flights, all constructed tastefully, and we were pleased with the recommended fried eggs and tots. Our server, Rachel, was one of the best servers I've ever had and was happy to answer all of our questions. This spot is a gem, and I am planning on coming back soon to try their cocktails!"

The Porchetta was magical. It was smokey and porky and fatty and everything you want out of porchetta. Their fried chicken livers are amazing too. I don't know anything about whiskey but the Bourbon Margarita was very good. I have had friends who do like whiskey swoon at their selection. Find out about the Beast Feast. For a group of people you get a whole pig for $300. I'm looking forward to my gang going in a few weeks!

Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Jessica L.,1,10/11/2024,6,WA,"This dining experience for their tasting menu was a terrible disappointment. I can't exaggerate enough how unsatisfying and way too salty the dishes were. And the desserts were soaked in alcohol, like why? The owner and chefs there really need to taste the dishes they are serving. How can you serve something almost inedible and charge $700+ for two people. We have been to other tasting menus in Seattle and this is somewhere you should stay away. I would say the night went bad once we noticed it took 20+ minutes in between dishes. I've never experienced a tasting menu that took 3+ hours to finish. There was a foie gras pasta dish that should not be served to anyone for any reason.. it was really hard to chew and swallow. Mostly the dishes tasted like salt, sugar, and alcohol... This restaurant is inconsistent with their dishes: 1. We were celebrating a birthday and two others around us were also celebrating. Our birthday dish was the only one without a candle... odd. 2. My partner and I both did the non-alcoholic drink pairing and for some reason our drinks were not served the same level of liquid and ice.. a little weirdOverall I'm glad we got to experience this place and won't be recommending this place to anyone."
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Leon S.,1,06/11/2016,5,NV,Overpriced and under delivered. $600 for 2 and the experience was a joke. What a mistake.

Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Andrew J.,3,6/14/2022,15,WA,"It was a good meal but overpriced.

We ordered their Papparedelle and it was pretty tasty and delightful. The spicy ragu was extremely mouthwatering and delightful and we definitely enjoyed it. I just hope that they could upgrade some of their drinks to make it more tasty and interesting.
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,George S.,4,10/19/2023,25,WA,"Been hearing about this place for a long time and finally was able to try it. Very cozy atmosphere, pretty cute decorations and great service.Although I heard about this place so many times before, I still don't know what I was walking into, and I have no idea about the food they serve.But since I love food I was willing to try, and I was excited. The course meal started with oysters and caviar, followed by sliced beef tounge, and then the noodle pasta with anchovy flakes, with sorbet as intermission. At this point I'm already a bit full, but the pork and wagyu beef makes it difficult to stop.Everything was very tasty and delicious. This is a pricey restaurant, but we definitely get our money's worth."

The food was pretty good, the ambiance and atmosphere is very chic and very much similar to other fine dinning establishments. The food was pretty different. I still don't know how I feel about pigeons for main protein course. I was hoping for something more for the price. And the additional truffle shavings on the pasta was pretty lack luster. My only complaint is that the service is very slow. By the end we ran out of the restaurant because we were there till 11:55pm. I get that they wanted to serve everyone at the same time with all our courses simultaneously but some people are very slow and we had to wait for them. I was just exhausted by the end. Food was 8.5/10 service was about 6/10 over all I'll say everything was about 7.5/10."
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Stewart H.,4,12/24/2019,10,DC,"I don't attend fancy dinners, but decided to splurge once with another couple. Simply amazing! The food had layers of flavor that literally became the topic of conversation until the next dish. Drinks were endless and the atmosphere melted away as the focus was on food and company. Definitely considering making progressive dinners like this a regular thing."
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Mark W.,4,8/26/2018,10,WA,"Highly recommend this place! Food is delicious. It is modernized Italian food with a twist. What I love about the food is that the flavors are all very subtle yet they have a small kick of a unique ingredient. So if your not a fan of food with very strong flavors, or a not yet used to having powerful ingredients, this is a great place to start introducing your pallette to new and unique flavors(high end cuisine). Best part about the restaurant in my opinion is the open concept and how you can see how the chefs are preparing your food. It is very interesting and amusing to see how these types of meals are being prepared from start to finish. And how everyone in the kitchen seems to be creative with what they prepare. Overall had a great experience!"
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Ricardo S.,4,11/11/2017,3,WA,"Calm, collected, high quality modern cuisine dining. It's Italian inspired. Definitely a special occasion place and call ahead and let them know about dietary restrictions. I enjoyed the experience quite a bit."
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Brook B.,4,3/24/2017,5,WA,"Altura is my new favorite restaurant. My husband and I came here for our 5th anniversary and cannot wait to come back again. Yes, it's pricey, but worth every penny. Not to compare apples and oranges but I used to think I couldn't find any restaurant that would beat Ruth Chris as far as quality and flavors goes but Altura blew them outta the water."
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Sammy P.,4,9/28/2015,2,WA,Terrific and delightful. Thank you!

Since Panevino closed a tear ago, I had no Italian restaurant satisfying me around here. I used to live in Rome for 8 years, and now so mad at myself that didn't check your restaurant for years. Thank you so much for making this area better to live!!!!"

We were very impressed, should be 5 stars, but slow and pasta size."
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Daphne T.,4,10/19/2011,15,WA,"I generally only want to give 5 star reviews (meaning I just don't review places I think suck)- but I thought the food here was FABULOUS. A new coworker brought me here last week. I didn't realize it had just opened, and I don't normally go to restaurants until they've been open for a month or two. I just like to let them iron out the kinks.Anyway, the food was too good to not mention. The rib-eye was cooked to perfection. The chicken was moist and tender-and was served with roasted grapes! Even the bread was divine.There is just ONE thing keeping me from giving Altura 5 stars-the room. It's just a bit ""clunky"" for lack of a better word. Our table was hard to get in and out of, and my elbow would hit the wall when cutting my food. I mentioned it to them, and they seemed appreciative. The service was also excellent!"
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Riley J.,5,9/15/2023,5,WA,First time back after four years of drought and it's just as fantastic as always. Love the new single seating format and the food is off the hook.
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Olivia N.,5,5/22/2023,9,WA,"This represents the pinnacle of dining experiences I've had in Seattle. The ambiance of the restaurant is a blend of energetic and tranquil. I had previewed the sample menu prior to my visit, yet each dish still left me in awe. The meticulous attention to detail was simply remarkable. Opting for counter seating provided us with an exclusive view of the chefs crafting each inventive, refined, and delightful dish. I couldn't have enjoyed it more!"
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Kevin L.,5,1/25/2023,129,WA,"I had an incredible dining experience at this restaurant! The produce was incredibly fresh and prepared immediately upon ordering, which really made a difference in the taste and quality of the dishes. The highlight of the meal for me was the red sponge cake - it was absolutely amazing and I couldn't stop raving about it to my friends afterwards. The restaurant also impressed me with its creative use of ingredients, such as the wagyu fat candles, which added an interesting and unique flavor to the dishes.In addition to the delicious food, the cooks were extremely friendly and made the dining experience even more enjoyable. I also highly recommend sitting at the kitchen counter, as you get to watch the chefs in action and even receive free samples of dishes. Overall, I want to thank the team at this restaurant for a truly great experience and can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious creations."
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,William A.,5,9/26/2022,5,SC,Truly incredible... highly recommend!
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Casey L.,5,03/05/2022,16,WA,Wonderful dining experience! We did the drinks pairing as well. I really liked that it was a mix of cocktails/wine and mocktails. Every course was well thought of. Altura is certainly on the expensive side but certainly worth a visit!
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Shu W.,5,06/06/2021,5,WA,Very good restaurant with impeccable reception. The staff are very pleasant and very kind. We appreciated the time taken by the waiter to explain the dishes we did not know.
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Justin C.,5,4/22/2021,4,CA,"Altura is a gem. Incredible attention to detail from start to finish. Bites are meticulously plated and seasoned perfectly with the addition of heat in appropriate proportions. In terms of service, Chef prepares everything as you roll in. I was fortunate enough to sit in front of chef's counter, where we watched everything prepared as we sat down. Meaning, the second I walked in, our dishes six courses down were being freshly assembled. Canapés breaming with color and visually appealing juxtaposition, all adorn in front seat with beautiful fresh greens like red vein sorrel. The dishes rolled out seamlessly as service flowed with the kitchen. Everyone around us felt at home as the food continued to pour in. From the first few bites we got to witness one said plate our food for the next course, while the other side prepared our dishes for the following. Almost in unspoken synchronicity everything streamed onto our view. My friend, who had never witnessed pasta being freshly prepared, stared in awe as Chef rolled fresh raviolo without hesitation. As the drinks poured, and the dishes were consumed, we ended the night with a phenomenal series of dessert bites with minor table side service to finish. To sum everything altogether, I must say, this restaurant exceeded my expectations of what Seattle's fine dining scene had to offer. I'm thrilled to see this restaurant standing still after the coils of pandemic had ruined our restaurant industries left and right. If anything, last night stood as a testament and will to the determination this team has to delivering what really good food is to our beautiful Emerald City."

Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Sonya O.,5,03/06/2020,6,WA,Amazing meal as usual. Excellent service. Walked in shortly after opening and were seated without fuss or hesitation. Every bite created thoughtfully. Got the wagyu and didn't regret it. Appreciate the take home menu and truffles.
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,Jessica P.,5,3/30/2019,302,IL,"This restaurant isn't eligible for a Michelin star (or 3) as it's in the wrong city for that. But Altura is most certainly a contender for it when and if Michelin comes to Seattle. We sat at the counter tonight and had such an incredible experience! We sat by Bridget, who was working the sauté station. Also nearby was the head chef, Nathan Lockwood. So. Delicious. So unpretentious. Such depth to the flavors and such unusual combinations. Super fresh and seasonal ingredients, which were honored by their treatments. The crew works in an open kitchen with a calm and precision. It isn't stuffy, it isn't rigid but it is polished and clean. We're from chicago. We know good food. This isn't as fancy shmancy as Alinea, but it is just as delicious and honestly one of the best meals I've had. Thank you Altura!"

My husband and I came in late December to celebrate our birthdays. Word to the wise show up hangry (hungry to the point that you are angry about it)- we made the mistake of only being hungry and towards the end became too full to finish the desserts. As others have mentioned the menu is predetermined so all you have to do is sit back and enjoy the experience. This place deserves some kind of michelin star - Bravo!"
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,Jerry L.,5,12/30/2017,129,TX,This one of the best tasting menu restaurants I've ever eaten at anywhere. The wine pairing really add to the experience and the small seating capacity lends to an intimate dining experience. A pricey dinner but par excellence and well worth the cost!!
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,CC A.,5,12/27/2017,5,CA,"This place is divine. I highly recommend sitting at the bar so you can catch all the action from the chef that runs an amazing tight ship. Sitting at the bar also allows you to ask the chef/sous chefs about the food, the ingredients and gives you that perk that they make you something special specifically for you. I went when I was having dietary restrictions due to allergy and they prepared amazing, delectable dishes that didn't skip a beat despite my multiple restrictions. If you are looking for special, romantic, small, quaint place with orgasmic food, this is the place. If you want to impress a foodie, take him/her there."
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,Fanlian T.,5,11/26/2017,14,NY,This is the BEST restaurant I have ever been to! Every dish is amazing and tasty~ love this restaurant

Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,Woman R.,5,1/20/2017,2,WA,The chef has never disappointed me once.

Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,James A.,5,07/08/2016,15,PA,I was lucky enough to eat at the counter at Altura while on business in Seattle my last night. This place was recommended to me by a friend back in NYC and I am glad I checked it out!Although I was still jet lagged and quite a bit tipsy I had an excellent meal. The chefs tasting menu is an excellent value and holds up to any michelin star equivalent in other cities I have been too. It was nice to just chill out and watch the chefs behind the counter prepare all the different courses with such precision. Also the wine pairing was great with the sommelier tailoring it to my preference of no white wine. There were some unusual wines and it was a nice experience to enjoy so many in one night. I rarely yelp but had to about this place!
Altura,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/altura-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Chad W.,5,4/20/2015,11,OR,"We ate at Altura last weekend and the food, service and atmosphere were all wonderful! There are lots of inventive choices for each course and lots of options for tasting menus with and without wines. We sat at the ""chef's table"" overlooking the kitchen area and it was fascinating. Even if you think you know how a restaurant kitchen might run, you can learn something here!Thanks, Nathan, for a fabulous meal start to finish!"

Imaginative (venison ravioli with chocoate infused sauce!) and extremely well balanced taste and texture in every dish. Kudos to the chef. It was my husbands birthday, and it was most excellent. Especially loved the razor clams with semolina crust. Just outstanding. Tough to get a reservation, but worth doing so well in advance to have a special meal at this top notch seattle restaurant. Pricing was fair--$49 for three courses of your choice!Yummy."

Let's be clear that the food and cocktails here are great, the flavors and plating of various dishes are amazing. But I've seen the progression of decline in service that has lead to horrendous customer service. I don't think I've ever had a waiter tell me, ""it's been 10mins and you haven't order anything, and we over booked reservations tonight and need the table in 30mins""I am very disappointed in any establishment that will approve of anyone with such unprofessionalism and disrespectful attitude towards patrons. We had just sat down and the menu wasn't pulling up on our phones. I also don't find it pleasing to hear restaurants are over booking reservations and rushing people to eat. That's so unpleasant to hear from a restaurant that I've dinned at many times before. After this experience I think I'm going to stay away from here for a while or just get Togo, becuase dealing with their rude staff and workers has made this place very irritating to dine at."

Surrounding tables with larger groups of friends were having fun with some cool looking cocktails, which may be a good enough reason to come here."

The vibe? Equal parts ""your rich friend's remodel"" and ""Instagrammer's paradise."" The food? Actually, shockingly good. The kind of Italian that makes you pause mid-bite to question every sad spaghetti night you've ever had.The staff? Friendly, but with that ""cooler-than-you"" Seattle edge--like, yeah, they know you're impressed, and they're totally fine with it. Prices? Let's just say your wallet might need a hug after, but honestly, worth it.In short: Di Fiona is annoyingly perfect, like Seattle itself. Pretentious, beautiful, and somehow irresistible. Damn it, I'll be back."

Di Fiora,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/di-fiora-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Yvonne C.,5,11/13/2024,5,WA,"Di Fiora consistently knocks it out of the park with every visit! First and foremost, the atmosphere is simply stunning. They refresh the décor with the seasons, ensuring it's always a feast for the eyes--truly an Instagram-worthy haven.Our culinary adventure included dishes like Kow Soi, crab fried rice, steak, garlic pork over rice, crispy garlic chicken, duck avocado curry, seafood tom yum soup, and Vietnamese crunchy rolls, all beautifully plated. While everything we tried was delicious, the standout stars were undoubtedly the duck avocado curry and the crispy garlic chicken. The curry was, without a doubt, the finest I've encountered in any Thai restaurant--rivaling even some of the best Peking duck I've tasted! Though no one asked about my preferred spice level, the flavor and heat were perfectly balanced, leading me to dip nearly everything in that luscious avocado curry.The crispy garlic chicken is always cooked to perfection, with a garlic dressing that's downright addictive. I find myself craving this spot at least once a month, and we'll continue to return for a consistently enjoyable meal that never disappoints. Di Fiora truly knows how to curry favor with its patrons!"

Di Fiora,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/di-fiora-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Kayla F.,5,2/23/2024,18,,"First off, Gui was incredibly friendly, attentive, and helpful. He not only seated us but also served as our server throughout the meal. While everyone who assisted us was very kind, our primary interaction was with him, and he truly excelled in his role.As for the food, I'm perplexed by any previous reviews describing it as ""bland."" Unless they mean it's not as intensely spicy as vindaloo curry or ghost pepper level, I'm not sure where that criticism is coming from. Speaking as someone who has an extensive spice cabinet and is often critical of under-seasoned dishes, I can confidently say this place was outstanding. My partner and I dined here last night, and we were both thoroughly impressed. We ordered the crispy duck with green curry, the house carbonara, the ahi appetizer, the coconut soup, coconut crepe cake, and a total of three cocktails. Every dish was excellent; we were particularly enamored with the coconut soup, which we wished we could buy by the gallon. The duck and carbonara were also exceptional, bursting with full flavor, and impeccably prepared. While the ahi appetizer wasn't quite on the same level as the rest of the meal, it was still quite good--my partner especially enjoyed it. Overall, the dining experience was stellar, and we're already planning our next visit before we have to leave town. We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town!"

We ordered the steak and crab fried rice, which both turned out to be very delicious. The steak had unique Asian spices that blend very well together with the meat and salad on the side. The fried rice was soft and tasty and I kept wanting more. We will definitely come back to try other dishes :)Note: they have a reservation system and are usually fully booked. We didn't make a reservation beforehand but managed to get in after waiting for half an hour. So make your reservation."

I love their wings because when you eat them with the sauce, it taste amazing, and when you eat them without the sauce they taste EVEN BETTER. Its almost like magic. I swear I am not even lying because without the sauce it taste so refreshing, and their is a hint of a lemon lime taste at the end. Its amazing. I love this place so much. My cousins and I went for the first time for a galantines event we were doing and we all were mind blown. Its cozy, cute, comfy, yummy, and the service and drinks were bomb as well. Five stars all the way, they never let down."

The fried calamari and crab fried rice were especially enjoyable. We also tried the Malaysian Coconut Soup with seafood and the rainbow salad. Although I typically consume white woodear mushrooms in sweet soups, I appreciated the texture of the mushrooms in the soup here. Additionally, the rainbow salad would be visually appealing on Instagram. This restaurant is an ideal location for a romantic date or a night out with friends."

There is absolutely no system in place for the Togo orders. They are definitely unable to keep up with the demand of business. There is no social distancing happening when you pick up your order! None of the employees are wearing mask. This place is a covid trap waiting to happen. Do not order food here as they are not prepared for the demand or have a safe system In place. On top of that, the guy GARY who works the front table is not friendly at all and completely stressed and unprofessional. He is RUDE AF! Sorry fogon, officially going down the street for safe Mexican food! Absolutely no excuse for the horrible customer service from GARY. I would like an explanation from the owners as why they are putting customers at risk but not following CDC guidelines to wear a mask. It went to affect April 3rd! Also, during a pandemic when people should be really be nice to each other you have the worst person GARY at the front helping customers who has the worst attitude ever. I am coming out of my house to support you as a restaurant and I'm treated like that is completely unprofessional. It says a lot about a restaurant when you see all the reviews and there is absolutely no response from the owners. Good or bad."

This place tends to get very crowded and sometimes the lines get long. They do have a lot of seating so it turn around pretty quick. Most of the staff members are friendly but you can tell that it does get a little overcrowded at times and things get missed. It's a good place to go if you are getting ready to go out and get hammered or are coming back from getting hammered. I just wouldn't think of going here for regular dinner or a date. There are just too many options to eat in Seattle for better quality (except you will pay more).

The mojito was fresh with the right amount of liquor, the Queso Fundido had a good amount of spicy chorizo and was truly really cheesy, and I'm glad I had enough room to have some of the flans.

Despite the hour and a half wait (when we were told 45m-1h) and loud ambience, the chips, salsa, guac, and food were delicious.Everyone in the group got the entree with meat, rice, and beans so we got to try different dishes. I had the pollo asado and was surprised to see a large slab of chicken on my plate. But I didn't even need a knife it was that tender. And don't even get me started on the handmade corn tortillas!

COMMUNION Restaurant and Bar,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/communion-restaurant-and-bar-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Amanda P.,1,4/21/2024,13,WA,"My recent dining experience at Communion in Seattle was nothing short of disappointing. From lackluster dishes to poor service, it fell far below expectations.Firstly, the gumbo was bland, lacking in flavor, and the seafood was overcooked, resulting in a less-than-pleasant texture. The Mac and cheese, while a classic favorite, was ruined by an excessive amount of smoky flavor. Even the cosmopolitan tasted more like watered-down Kool-Aid than a crafted beverage.To add to the disappointment, the service was subpar. Our waitress seemed disinterested and unfriendly, displaying an attitude that made us feel as though we should be grateful just to be dining there. Her lack of helpfulness only exacerbated our already tarnished experience.Overall, Communion failed to deliver on both the culinary and service fronts. For those seeking a memorable dining experience in Seattle, I would advise looking elsewhere."
COMMUNION Restaurant and Bar,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/communion-restaurant-and-bar-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Boykin S.,1,4/28/2021,2,CA,I am definitely not at home here. Twice the hostess turned me away claiming the empty seats were for reservations only. I never expected such snobby behavior from a soul food joint. Evidently gentrification turned these Black folks bougy to where they turn away customers who aren't white hipsters living in the area. A decade ago East Union was a crime infested area with struggling Black owned businesses begging for customers. What a difference a decade makes. So I took my money to another business with much better customer service does not care about the social caste of the customer.
COMMUNION Restaurant and Bar,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/communion-restaurant-and-bar-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Redd B.,2,06/03/2022,44,WA,"I wanted to like this place, I really did. However, the food was average, service was fine, and branding/marketing is corny (e.g., calling their sushi Hood Sushi - why?!) Based on their social media pictures, I thought I was going to take one bite of a dish, slam my hand down utensil tightly gripped and let out an expletive in joy. But, no, I took one bite of the hood sushi and could not discern the flavors of the catfish or other ingredients. I primarily tasted seaweed and rice and the watermelon sauce just added salt (a lot of it) to the mix. Overall, the food didn't live up to the hype. Though, I may give the food one more chance because the catfish and grits LOOKED amazing (all their food looks delicious on Instagram and in-person). All the food I ate was just okay. First, I tried the sushi which didn't offer the fusion flavor the chef intended. The shrimp toast would have been great if it wasn't over toasted. Also, the greens were too oily for me."

COMMUNION Restaurant and Bar,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/communion-restaurant-and-bar-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Linda L.,3,11/09/2023,116,WA,"My recent visit to Communion left me with mixed feelings. While there were some highlights, there were also areas that could use improvement.Food Quality: Everything we ate seemed overcooked and dry. It seemed as if it was reheated too many times, idk but it wasn't what I was hoping for cause almost every review I saw made it seem like it was gonna be some of the best food in the PNW. The drinks were good though. The best part of the meal was the watermelon salad. The flavored hot sauce just tasted like regular hot sauce to me so that was kinda disappointing. I saw some Nigerian and Carribean-inspired items, so I tried the akara; they were a miss for me personally. Service: The service was friendly and attentive. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and offered suggestions. However, there was a bit of a delay in getting our food, which was a downside, especially when you're hungry. (But the delay in food wasn't an issue in totality because it was busy so that's expected)Ambiance: It has a laid-back and casual atmosphere, which fits the cuisine. The décor and music were enjoyable. It was kinda weird that they picked and chose who to enforce their dress code with and not. Portion Size: The portion sizes were quite generous it was enough for two of us and more. Drinks: The drinks were really good and fit the theme. The names were unique and some were already premade so all you had to do was pour and enjoy.Overall Experience: While my visit had its share of ups and downs, there were some notable aspects. The flavors and ambiance created a pleasant atmosphere, but the food quality was inconsistent, and the wait times were slightly longer than expected. I would recommend giving this restaurant a try, but I hope they focus on improving the consistency of their dishes to make it a more reliable dining option. It's a three-star experience for now, but with some tweaks, it could certainly reach higher heights."

The ambiance of everyone sitting close to each other was a great idea. Everyone there was nice, friendly, & seem to enjoy the food. The customers were very diverse although restaurant is black owned. I enjoyed the creative menu. Hood Sushi is delicious. The dumplings hit the spot as well and tasted like a cabbage. I wish I had a dozen Hoe cakes. Fried okra without the slime left me in awe.

Sat outside in comfort with heaters and started with our server's suggestion of the salmon corn chowder, rich and smooth. And don't come here without trying the okra, crisp and just the lightest seasoning. For the entrees, the berbere smoked chicken was cut and presented to perfection. And the shrimp and grits are just another reason we'll come back. Service was impeccable."

We opted for the Chef's counter tasting menu and felt quite satiated by the fourth course. Not only were the staff engaging but the chefs and line cooks were equally interested in how we were doing, what dish stood out, etc. Not to mention the free beignets from Andrew, who was happy to share his newly mastered technique with us. The food was incredibly layered with wonderful ingredient selection, preparation and execution. The oysters with bacon were some of the best cooked oysters I ever had and don't sleep on the greens as presentation, they paired so well with sauce too. Highly recommend a visit if you like a dining experience to be engaging and each dish to be well designed and paired exquisitely with all ingredients. Next time, I'm opting for the wine pairing."

What brought me to the restaurant was the cool drink menu which was inspired by one of my favorite shows-The Wire. We were able to reserve a seat at the chefs counter and it was worth it. The chef and other kitchen staff were amazing. The interacted with us, answered with questions etc. The octopus is absolutely phenomenal and so was the pork chop and sablefish dish.

They had a wide selection of drinks to choose from, catering to various preferences. The service was quick and friendly, adding to the overall positive experience. The staff was attentive without being intrusive, making sure we had everything we needed.The prices were fair for the quality and quantity of food and drinks provided.

re:public,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/re-public-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=20,Jessica R.,4,08/09/2014,4,WA,"Strolled in for brunch midday on a Saturday, not really knowing what to expect. I had previewed a brunch menu online that looked like it was on point, but I was really sold by the fact that they take online reservations for brunch - unheard of in Seattle - and all I really wanted was some good food in a decent atmosphere without the hours long wait that generally trademark brunch in this city.While this is certainly one of the many dinner/bar locations that brunch offerings are clearly their second line of business, with ""brunch"" written on a chalkboard for diners to take notice while they are in for a drink on a Friday night, I was pleasantly surprised at the airiness of the place with the roll-up opened on a nice summer day.Service was great - timely, thoughtful, and kind. Mimosas were generous in the champagne department and were mixed with fresh oj. And the food - THE FOOD! I ordered the beef short rib chilaquiles and the hubs ordered the fried chicken/waffle. The chilaquiles were delicious! Topped with radish and cilantro, a side of black brand with cotija cheese, and served with crème fraîche, a lime wedge, and green ""diablo salsa"" - just the right amount of heat. The fried chicken and waffle were also amazing - the chicken was juicy on the inside and had perfectly crispy skin, and the waffle was sprinkled with pecans and bacon and topped with a cardamon butter that was to die for! The perfect sweet/savory brunch item.If you're looking for a fabulous brunch without the wait, re:public is now definitely on the top of my list."

The red letters on the sign make it that much more magical. Anywho, we had a private company event here and I definitely indulged. The ambiance was very romantic so I could definitely see myself cruising here for a nice glass of vino on a weekend or weekday with a sweet lil' thang.I had the crab puffs as an appetizer and they were quite scrumptious, some amazing lasagna and pasta for my entree. After I was almost all the way full I tried their rib eye and was immediately blown away. This place wasn't too pricey so definitely worth your time if you're in the area.Bonus info: This is about 1 notch up from Joey's in SLU. It's more expensive so I would recommend Joey's if you're just having drinks and/or a light appetizer and Re:Public if you want a higher class menu and ambiance."

This has become a monthly treat for me and a couple co-workers. Fantastic wine list, amazing food, small portions but worth every penny. You just have to get a little wine-drunk first and savor each bite. I wish I had done a review when this was still on the menu, but I am going to mention it anyway...foie gras creme brulee. Yep, most amazing thing I have ever had in my entire life. I couldn't tell if I was eating a meal or a dessert, omg, if you guys are reading this please, please bring it back! I have only sat at the bar, but service is always attentive even when its busy. Until last week I was only in on weekday nights, but I stopped by for a martini by myself on a friday and it was packed! Definitely a fun scene on the weekends if you are looking to meet people or come in with a group, probably not as good for a date seeing as it was super loud, but good for them for being busy. A+"

Usually have a great experience. Whoever was the hostess tonight made me never want to return. I walk in at 10:25 to be seated and am told their kitchen closes at 10:30. Which is odd cause I've never been told this especially cause I only order oysters and a few drink around this time and day. Needless to say I won't be back.
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,emily c.,1,10/11/2023,1,WA,"I am still reeling from shock of how horribly myself and my family were treated. I, visibly pregnant, was seated at a table with a bench on one side and 2 chairs on the other. My 2yo and 5yo were both sitting with me on the bench side waiting for my husband to arrive. There were 3 other similar tables next to us, all still unseated. The hostess kindly brought us crayons for my children to color on the paper laid across the table. My daughter was coloring, never straying once from our table. My son was guardian of the crayons. On three occasions, my *near 2yo* screamed loudly ""MINE!"" when my daughter went for a crayon. I am well aware this is less than ideal. It is a phase he is in, screeching any time he is excited or mad or expressing emotions. Before and after each of those moments, he was calm and happy and just fine. Each time he did it, I did my best to get him to stop immediately. We had been there all but 10 minutes. The manager, Christopher Fischbach, approached me and said ""You are going to have to reign this in."" I asked ""excuse me?"" And he said ""you are going to have to reign this in. We can't have your children running around and the screaming will have to stop."" I replied that my daughter hadn't left the table once and then asked how he suggest I stop my not yet 2yo son from screaming?"" He said he didn't know. I asked ""and what if I can't? Will we be escorted out?"" And he said ""if it is excessive, maybe so. We have to seat these other tables.""At this point I was so incredulous, I could not believe this was being said to a paying customer, let alone the fact that a child was being targeted. I asked if this was routine for them, he did not reply and he walked away. I still cannot believe this happened. I am appalled. I am ashamed to say that we stayed, but I refuse to be bullied. Yeah, they got my money, but I have my dignity. And I hope Christopher (who, no, does not have children of his own) treats families trying their absolute best with the respect they deserve moving forward. He was a pretty massive disappointment to humanity tonight.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money here. The food was not remotely worth what they lack entirely in service."

As you've probably gathered, my partner is a transgender woman and I fully support/love her, we were eating at the Old Spaghetti Factory in Southcenter when my partner said she felt someone staring at her, I was going to assure her that kno one was staring, however, I was appalled to see this kid working there standing in the kitchen entrance pointing at her, I stared the kid down until he walked away. I immediately asked for the manager, the manager who came over to help us was completely drunk, he asked us if we were sure he was pointing at us, and he offered to pay for our food.

Tonight sept 15th 2018 we called and were told we couldn't make a reservation and to just come in. We arrived at 6:50 and were turned away saying that there is no space for us ( there was plenty of space as we could see) We were told there was a burlesque showing going on later in the evening in the back.

We enjoyed a very nice lunch for two, linguine vongole and the squid ink pasta seafood special.The awkward moment arrived when the server brought us an empty plate with two birthday candles absent of anything except the two candles.We felt as though he presented an ""empty"" birthday wish. I am still dumbfounded by the gesture. Honestly I would have preferred no recognition rather than the empty plate presentation. That was the one star reception we received.

The problem was the cost of the food for the quantity and quality. We really went to see the perfomace thinking it would be a fun way to spend dinner. Well the performace is five minutes at best, every 30-45 minutes so don't go for that. The food was way over priced. I spent $44.00 for a small bowl of (premade) gluten free pasta with a bland cream sauce, a butterscotch pudding (which was pretty good) and a glass of water-yes $44!!! . Since I had to eat GF I didn't get bread unless I wanted to pay $3 more for Udi's bread. There were no dinner salads, veggies, meat for my dish or anything else. I hate the Italian Denny's (Olive Garden) but have to say I have had better meals there and for a better price. Felt a bit duped by the allure of a cool performace which is the only reason I was willing to spend that kind of money on pasta only to find out it the performance wasn't really part of the ambiance.

The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=10,EmmLee W.,1,9/16/2013,8,WA,"We planned our meal two months in advance, reserved a table, and hoped to top off the last night of our Seattle vacation with an excellent view, meal and drinks.We were seated on the patio, jammed into a corner but jutting out into the walkway, where we were jostled by staff and other diners. We ordered sodas while taking a moment to look at the wine menu, and decided to share an order of the calamari with spinach. This was okay, a bit overcooked and chewy, but we had high hopes for the meal - I ordered linguine with clams, and my husband ordered clams and mussels.I had one bite of my pasta with clams, and couldn't eat anymore. The pasta was overcooked, but all of that was masked by the amount of sodium in the ""broth"" - you could taste nothing BUT salt, as though a cup of it had been poured into the cooking liquid. The acidity burned my tongue and scoured the inside of my mouth. I couldn't taste or eat properly for two days afterward. My husband's clams and mussels had no seasoning or taste, other than that of steamed and overcooked seafood. No garlic, wine, herbs or anything else. It was as if they'd steamed the shellfish and dumped them in the bowl. Also, no pasta or other sides were served with that dish: $26 or so for a bowl of flavorless steamed mussels and clams. We declined to order something else, and asked for our check. This was the only time in our lives that we've ever walked out of a restaurant. Although the manager comped our soda and calamari, we left a comparable amount on the table for the waitress and staff. We figured they shouldn't be left without the tip they'd have received had the chef and kitchen staff not put out such an embarassing ""meal"". We spent an hour trying to find another restaurant that was open in the area after 9 PM, which oddly enough is not easy to do, especially as we'd walked from our rental to The Pink Door.As far as ambience and staff: the greeter and our waitress were very nice. The place was okay, but other than some cute decoration and a good band, it wasn't exceptional - certainly not enough to balance out the mediocre starter and inedible meal. I can honestly say I'd not recommend this restaurant to anyone."

While the ambiance and drink selection were noteworthy, my overall impression was tainted by uncomfortable seating, lackluster food, and an unpleasant aftermath.Let's start with the positives. The restaurant's ambiance and wine selection create a cozy and sophisticated atmosphere, making it a suitable spot for drinks and socializing. However, when it comes to the dining experience, there are considerable drawbacks.The seating arrangement was notably uncomfortable, detracting from what could have been an enjoyable evening. The chairs lacked ergonomic design, making it difficult to relax and fully savor the dining experience.Turning to the food, I ordered the chicken, expecting a premium dish given the prices. Regrettably, the reality fell short of expectations. The chicken was disappointingly dry, reminiscent of a budget BBQ chicken one might find at a grocery store. The lack of succulence and flavor left me questioning the value for the cost.Unfortunately, my disappointment did not end with the underwhelming meal. The next day, I experienced persistent gas and an upset stomach. While I'm not quick to attribute these symptoms solely to the restaurant, it does raise concerns about the quality of ingredients or food handling practices.In light of my overall dissatisfaction and the subsequent digestive discomfort, I believe the establishment should consider refunding my purchase. A dining experience should leave patrons satisfied and comfortable, and unfortunately, Purple Café and Wine Bar fell short of these expectations."

The last two times I have been there in the last two months, the servers just seemed to be checked out and going through the motions. There is no passion in their work, and they are no longer trying to create an ambiance or a dining experience, and when I drop 2-300 for a dinner for 2, I expect more. I went there this evening, and again the waitress comes over with a nice bottle of wine, but where is the sommelier? Have they gotten rid of this program where the Som comes over and decants your wine. I loved talking about wine with the Som, and thought it added a nice touch. Guess Harvest Vine and Luc will now get my business. Goodbye Purple Cafe. My filet mignon was not medium, and even though I told my server, she didn't really seem to care, and I am not one to send food back unless she felt it should return to the kitchen, and she didn't say anything. The filet came by itself, so I found myself hungry afterwards and ordered two cheese tastings which were nice as always. There just isn't anything special about Purple any longer........it's just get the customer in, and get them out...............I can feel a better energy and have a special dining experience elsewhere. Seattle has some great restaurants. Sorry Purple........won't be back. GC"

This place had some of the rudest, most pretentious @$$holes I have ever met. So we went in late on a Tuesday night after a Mariners game, as my buddies sister and friend were in town from the East Coast. After ordering a shot and a drink, we were content for about 45 minutes. My buddy ordered a drink and about 20 minutes later hadn't received it. When he finally received his drink, I ordered another, and jokingly asked him if I could get it in less than a half hour. Turns out we didn't look like the crowd they prefer, so he decided that my joke meant I was intoxicated and didn't deserve to be served anymore. It was my 2nd drink in an hour, AND we had ordered food. After speaking with a manager, he agreed that I did not look intoxicated, but they don't undermine the ""judgement of their staff"". Maybe my joke was in poor taste, but I was trying to be lighthearted, not offensive, and if you work in a bar, you should be ready to deal with garbage from rude patrons, and a little banter at the bar shouldn't be handled like that. 0 stars is what they deserve,, and I guarantee I will never return to this place.

Enjoy a flight of wine and cheese pairing or something else before you order. I'm definitely not a wine buff and my wife is no expert, but we enjoy the ability to have a relaxing conversation and enjoy some new wines we normally wouldn't try. The staff is very helpful in recommending combinations and they don't make you feel out of place if you aren't a wine expert. The entrees have all been quite good and very reasonably priced, with the exception of the lobster mac' n cheese (although it is well worth the $27). My only complaint is how cold it sometimes feels. I would love to see a nice fireplace added to warm things up in the winter."

The wine markup isnt so bad, but that should be expected at a wine bar. They have a great wine list and good options for tastings of wine and cheeses by the flight. The bar doesnt know how to make a martini, but once again they are a wine bar. If anything, I would say they should simplify the food menu. I found it to be too many choices, found myself spending too much time reviewing the menu, but I went there for wine and appetizers, not for dinner, so I may be biased."

The décor is poetic from the choice of color and accessories in the establishment. The special service offered for a romantic date is just on another level. I think it would be had for any person to turn down an engagement  or wedding proposal that is made in this establishment. More to the service and the décor, the accommodation facilities befit loyalty. Spending a night at the establishment is an epic experience. I would definitely come back for a second date at this place and recommend it to my friends with a lot of confidence."

The ambiance is great -- dim lighting that worked seamlessly with the high ceilings & impressive floor-to-ceiling wine tower. The wait staff was extremely friendly, and made great food recommendations! We tried:- the Riesling -- sweet and fruity!- baked brie -- no need to elaborate, just get it.- seafood stew -- recommended by our waiter, and it was so good!

The service was friendly and the staff very attentive. We REALLY Really enjoyed our meal here. Probably one of the best corned beef hash I've had. The corned beef was tender, flavorful; potatoes perfectly fried; delicious rye bread and two fried eggs on top. My friend had the fried egg sandwich (provolone, bacon, egg, greens) which he thought was great. We had a vegan with us as well and the server said the chefs are really good at accommodating food requests. They made the Espanola vegan by replacing the eggs with more veggies and avocados. Everyone was satisfied. Great service as well. Facility was clean including the bathrooms. I can confidently recommend Purple Cafe to others!"

I wanted to take her somewhere nice and make it memorable for her. She's a wine and cheese lover so I knew she'd appreciate this place but I also wanted to take her here so she could try something new as she doesn't have a very adventurous palate.First off, the ambiance was nice and romantic. She loved the tower of wine and spiral staircase in the middle of the restaurant. We started off upstairs in the lounge with a drink while we waited for our table and then headed to our table where we chose from the Tasting Bar menu.She was feeling a little adventurous so we had the the Duck Liver Pate and the Ahi Tuna Poke which were both spectacular. For our entrees, the lady chose Duck Confit and I had Filet Mignon. She LOVED the Duck and couldn't stop raving about it.After the numerous bottles of wine and all the delicious food, I'd say we had a pretty sexy evening."

We all learned something, and chose a bottle, which was great. We dared not ask its cost though we had asked for ""value."" A few ""tasting"" rounds of apps, some salads, and some great entrees, I had the pork, done nicely, and the to die for deserts..... we picked up another bottle. The check arrived and our new favorite was only $30, very nice Purple, very nice.But what blows me away about this place is the size of the space.

The roasted red pepper & goat cheese one is something I have cravings for from time to time, and the apple, walnut & stilton salad is great, too (it comes with a light, sweet, interesting champagne vinaigrette).Mondays are half-price bottle night. Recently, I was here with two friends and we shared a cheese flight to start, then we each had an entree and dessert, plus we shared a great bottle of pinot noir. It worked out to $33 each, including tip. You can't beat that!Their sorbets are always creative, fresh and delicious, and I love their sea salt caramels (you can now get an order of sea salt caramels to go, by the way! They make a great hostess gift).I love the decor here, too. Service is a tad slow, but knowledgable and friendly. When my husband and I went to lunch here as a little celebration on the day we picked up our marriage certificate, they brought us out champagne and sea salt caramels--on the house!We go here five or six times a year, and every single experience has been great!"

Musang Seattle,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/musang-seattle-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Evan J.,2,06/01/2022,6,WA,Unimpressive meal. French toast was cold when served. Only one server for the entire indoor dining area during weekend brunch time. therefore sluggish service.
Musang Seattle,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/musang-seattle-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Aaron B.,3,02/06/2025,16,CA,"I was really looking forward to celebrating my mother's birthday at Musang, especially after highlighting the occasion on our reservation. Unfortunately, the experience fell short in several ways. Despite our clear instructions, the staff completely overlooked the birthday, even going so far as to bring a dessert for the birthday celebrant at the table next to us. To add to the mix, our leche flan was forgotten for about 15 minutes until we had to remind them.On a positive note, the ambience was quite nice and the setting is definitely inviting. However, the service needs a lot of work if they hope to match the quality of their decor. Overall, a decent spot with plenty of potential, but the service mishaps really detracted from what should have been a special celebration. Three stars."
Musang Seattle,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/musang-seattle-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Queenie W.,3,08/10/2022,16,CA,Not open on 8/10. There wasn't a notice or anything on the window :c kinda disappointing
Musang Seattle,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/musang-seattle-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Michele S.,4,01/12/2024,243,WA,"I finally snagged reservations for Musang at a decent hour for dining with friends on a weeknight after work (plan ahead folks!). I was super excited to try this ""elevated"" Filipino food, as my experience of Filipino food has been more limited and more casual. The interior was inviting and warm, design that has been considered but isn't fussy or pretentious. The waitstaff were friendly and informative, able to answer our questions about ingredients and portions to share everything family style. I started with an Ube Lemon Soda. Wow, don't miss this delicate, refreshing vanilla lemon drink! I knew I definitely wanted the lumpiang and pancit, my go-to Filipino choices. My dining companions had little to no exposure to Filipino food and one person doesn't eat anything with seafood, so family style eating limited what i would normally choose just a bit. I am not a huge beef fan, but l love short ribs and the wait person recommended them, so that was our main. We rounded out dinner with a Brussels sprouts dish and garlic rice. Lumpiang and pancit are definitely done deliciously here. We were all scraping the pancit sauce onto our rice (definitely get the garlic rice!). The lumpiang probably has one of the best wrappers I have ever tasted, and the filling was a perfect blend of minced pork and shrimp, with an excellent vinegar based dipping sauce (sawsawan). The major disappointment of the evening was the short rib Kare Kare. Impressively sized and beautifully presented with a pool of peanut sauce and perfectly cooked veg tucked to the side, our meat was tough, chewy and difficult to get off the bone. The sauce/meat combo was flat and one dimensional. I have read other reviews of this dish where the meat was clearly prepared better, and described as ""fall off the bone."" Sadly we did not get that version of the dish. At $52 this was a dish no one wanted to finish or eat much of. The most delicious sounding dessert on the menu (a spiced apple ice cream dish) was not available, so we tried the corn bibinka. This was like a chewy rice flour cornbread with warm honey butter. Tasty, but not something I would order again, especially for dessert. Every seat was full during our 7PM visit and we were notified ahead of arriving dining time would be limited to 1 hour 45 minutes for a party of 3 due to turnover, as well as 22% service charge (they are very good about letting you know you don't have to add gratuity, but you are prompted when paying to choose a percentage or ""no tip"". Eater Reader, I can't choose no tip.) I don't have a problem with any of this for an experience, but it's not a structure I am going to generally choose for my average dining out. If someone wanted to go to Musang and invited me, I would definitely say yes, but I don't think it will be on my list of go-to suggestions unless I am looking for a special occasion restaurant in that part of town due to price, turnover pressure (which they aren't overt about), and difficulty in getting a reservation. However, it is definitely worth having the experience, whether you already love Filipino food or need an introduction. P.S. No pics because this was a night for enjoying company with friends who don't photograph their food."
Musang Seattle,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/musang-seattle-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Jimmy S.,4,1/16/2021,22,WA,I really liked both their spring rolls and their squers
Musang Seattle,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/musang-seattle-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Jason J.,5,10/12/2024,51,WA,"OMG the food was every bit as good as I had heard, and somehow even better.

Every dish was a masterpiece, blending ingredients in ways that showcased the chef's exceptional skill and creativity with Filipino dishes. And let's not forget the dessert the bibingka creation that balanced sweetness, texture, and visual appeal in a harmonious marriage.The service matched the quality of the food, with a staff that was attentive, knowledgeable, and passionate about the culinary offerings. If you're seeking a dining experience that transcends the ordinary and elevates your appreciation for fine cuisine, this is the place to be. Without a doubt, I'll be returning to savor more of their exceptional offerings in the near future."

Highly recommend making reservations if you plan on dining in. Wait time about 90 minutes when we came in, but was absolutely worth the wait with their hospitality alone. Food was delicious! The sauce for the lumpia was really good. Sisig and fried chicken was good. The gravy for the chicken was good on the chicken and the rice! For dessert we had the tsokoleyt tibok-tibok, which is like a mousse and was absolutely delicious that we ordered a second one. Very friendly staff and even made our youngest some puréed squash. Thank you for the excellent dining experience!!!"

I grew up with a lot of Filipino friends, and the food here brought back a lot of memories eating at their house. After dinner we noticed the Ube cheesecake wasn't on the menu. But the waiter was so amazing to get us some, off the secret menu and I was not let down. Go and try this place!"

Musang Seattle,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/musang-seattle-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=10,Del M.,5,02/08/2020,1,WA,"We are new CA transplants (please don't hate us) and not particularly familiar with the area. I wanted to take my Filipina wife somewhere special for her birthday. All the positive reviews here are spot on - trust them implicitly.Service. It abounds here. While we had an admittedly long wait because it was Friday night peak dinner hours the hostess was so gracious and polite throughout our time, and was so with all guests coming and going despite the pace; never once did she look flustered or less than cool (even when some expressed frustration when politely explained about the expected wait). She was also spot on with our wait estimate which to me also demonstrated she has her finger on the pulse of the place and knows her craft. This gracious humble knowledge permeated all staff. Our server was awesome, on top of things, aware of the menu and could explain about the dish nuances from a deep awareness that reflected passion not a disinterested standardized script being rattled off to get it over with. Patient and kind. She was also perfectly present - there at just the right moments without hovering. We met the sous chef later and I think she and my wife must have chatted for over a half hour and while much of it was in Tagalog so I only caught bits and pieces or when she intentionally shifted to English because she was intentionally including me - in any case it was warm and vulnerable filled with cheer and the joy present in hearing of my wife's experiences that night were evident (despite her being at the tail end of a 17hr on her feet bustling around day).Wow I can't believe I've written this much and haven't even gotten to the main attraction...THE FOOD!! I don't have the childhood memories to tie everything in emotionally but can say everything was delicious. Some uninformed or close minded purists might decry it's not authentic enough because various ingredients were swapped out. However they could not be more mistaken. Substitutions were the hallmarks of the dishes and epitomized Filipino traditions to use local use fresh and don't waste. Any changes were done with thought and care, creativity and artistry. You might notice a subtle difference but nothing ""doesn't belong"" and, at risk of heresy, manifest themselves as overall improvements to fix something not quite right in the original. From the very first bite my wife's eyes welled up with tears of joy and remembrance to days of her youth. This flood of thought and recollection permeated the evening as each new dish presented elicited a fresh cascade of memories and tears and left her feeling, really feeling, like her dearly missed and departed Momma had returned for her special birthday to cook her a treat.We look forward to many more evenings and special meals here and eager to see and experience what new seasonal flairs the talented chefs can come up with.Thank you again to all of the staff at Musang, for making a night to remember.(Sorry I didn't get into deep detail, but for reference we had: Lumpiang, Bola Bola, Sinigang, Steamed Rice, Beef Mechado, and then wrapped everything up with Flan Cake and Tibok Tibok -- there's nothing we had that I wouldn't recommend and the only thing that would prevent me from ordering each again would be wanting to try everything else on the menu)"

They weren't lying. This is my top 3 favorite sushi spot and it was my first time there! I ordered:Corn TempuraSeared Spicy Albacore w/ Crispy OnionJapanese CevicheSalmon w/ Black CaviarCreamy Popcorn Shrimp TempuraChili Edamame4 1/2 RollEverything was amazing. However, one SMALL complaint, although the flavor of the edamame was yummy, it was on the overcooked side. It felt mushy, I prefer for it to not be that soft. If it's your first visit, just order off their signature dish list. You won't be disappointed."
Katsu-ya Seattle,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/katsu-ya-seattle-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Alan S.,5,10/12/2020,218,CA,Got to be in town for the grand opening of the restaurant the food was fantastic given the difficult covid situation the event was small and only 2-4 people at each table.

Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Marco S.,1,3/15/2024,3,UT,This american restaurant that sells premium pretend italian food is a disgrace to the italian culinary culture.

Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Caleb E.,2,03/11/2016,10,WA,"Great service but wildly overpriced meals. We each had a pasta since we wanted to get some variety. My friend had the ""famous"" butter and sage, and I had the pork and beef ragu. The food was okay, but to pay $28 for a bowl of pasta is just over the top. Again, service was great, but I just can't recommend anyone pay that much for a bowl of noodles. The waiter recommended we split a pasta because they said the portion was large...which might be true if the noodles were thicker. We both finished ours in under 10 minutes (without rushing!)"

The food was high quality, and we expected the prices are to be that expensive, knowing the location. The bits are large enough to share, and the roasted meat special was a fantastic choice.

Unfortunately, the seating is a little awkward not sure why two tables would be placed in the center of the restaurant where servers and other patrons need to be walking by.

I always think good wine must be paired with good food which this place deserves. However, I didn't like the food being served in common plate to be shared with 2 other diners. I highlighted this to the waitress but my suggestion was not taken seriously. service"
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Anthony E.,4,08/09/2023,4,WA,On the menu there's an option to order EVERYTHING. That's what we did. It was a great experience by itself. The food are mostly tasty. The fresh pasta taste so good - especially liked the mini ravioli with rabbit. The duck breast and the tuna mayo appetizer also stand out. The service was exceptional as well. Overall it was a great experience
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Jose S.,4,6/18/2023,2,WA,We went with a group of 8 and did the family style Degustazione where they literally bring you everything on the menu over multiple courses. And it is not a small amount of food. Our waiter was fabulous and warned us that we should pace ourselves and he was right.
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Abigail C.,4,11/15/2021,12,CA,"After being told repeatedly that we needed to try Spinasse we finally did. I would say that it largely lived up to its reputation. The staff were extremely professional but also friendly. The menu had enough variation to make it possible for several different experiences but we made the mistake of ordering a succession of incredibly rich dishes rather than something light and crisp between the rich items. That said, everything was exceptional, if a bit much, but we had a great dinner and would highly recommend Spinasse, not that they need our endorsement."

This is probably the best spot I have gone to for lunch. Just improved my evening. On the off chance that you are searching for an incredible early lunch detect this is it.

The atmosphere and decor is nice enough and gives a good neighborhood italian family spot to eat. Service is friendly, but slow. The value for what you get was off-par. The shrimp were less than fresh, the salad was too trendy to be friendly - I don't know who started this trend, but a half wedge of lettuce that you have to cut up yourself does not make a salad enjoyable, nor contribute to a ""neighborhood"" vibe. Too high-end of an idea there--which I find really isn't enjoyable at any restaurant. Lunch or bar use might be better time to visit. Would not go back for dinner."

Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,CapHill C.,4,11/26/2010,16,WA,"Best advice: Just order the butter and sage pasta. Holy lord that is the best pasta I've ever and I mean EVER had in this town (the only close rival I can think of is Volterra in Ballard). Pair it with carrots, and you've got one perfect meal. We LOVE this place! Great atmosphere (although avoid sitting at the bar as it does seem to draw some poser-types, and you'll be subjected to their annoying conversations) ... and go early or make reservations as the space is a tad cramped. Service is okay, but you get the sense, sometimes, that they don't really like you and that they have better things to do or that they're more sophisticated than you (which is why I'm giving it 4 rather than 5 stars -- oh, and because it's a bit cramped) ... but the food is truly amazing. Promise."

Three letters- WOW! It was hard to get a reservation earlier than 8:30, but it was worth the wait. The staff was great, our waitress was so really knowledgable, helpful and funny. There was only one thing I didn't like, Campari and Soda is not my drink of choice. Now that's out of the way... everything that was delicious... the hand cut egg pasta with butter and sage, so simple... but it was my favorite thing. My favorite entree was the whole rainbow trout. Perfectly cooked. I suggest you let the waiter fillet it for you. And then finish the meal off with a pot of Herkimer coffee. We had friends in from out of town and this is a meal we'll always rememeber."

Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Jasper T.,5,10/09/2023,41,WA,"Spinasse has firmly secured its place as our absolute favorite restaurant, and every visit here is nothing short of a gastronomic delight. If there were a way to give this place more than five stars, I would do so without hesitation.Our latest visit to Spinasse was a testament to why we keep returning. We couldn't resist ordering our all-time favorites - the Ragu and Short Rib.The Ragu at Spinasse is, in a word, perfection. It's the kind of dish that makes you wonder if the chefs have secretly discovered a portal to Italy to source their ingredients. Handcrafted with love, the pasta was the ideal canvas for the rich, meaty, and profoundly satisfying ragu sauce. Each bite was a revelation, a harmonious blend of flavors that danced on our taste buds. It's a dish that defines comfort food; every spoonful warms the soul.The Short Rib is a true showstopper. The succulent, tender meat practically melts in your mouth, and the depth of flavors is nothing short of mesmerizing. The presentation is a work of art, but the real masterpiece is the taste. The slightly sweet undertones complement the savory richness of the dish, creating a symphony of flavors that's nothing short of extraordinary.Now, onto the only downside - getting a reservation! It's no secret that Spinasse is a sought-after dining destination, and it's not surprising, given their exceptional experience. The only drawback is that it can be challenging to secure a table, especially for impromptu visits. But I suppose that's a testament to their well-deserved popularity.The ambiance at Spinasse is intimate and inviting, making it perfect for a romantic evening or a special celebration. The staff is knowledgeable and incredibly accommodating, which adds to the overall charm of the place.In conclusion, Spinasse is a culinary treasure in Seattle, and their Ragu and Short Rib dishes are the stuff of dreams. While getting a reservation might require some planning, the experience is more than worth it. If you're a fan of authentic Italian cuisine served with passion and precision, Spinasse is a must-visit. It's our go-to place for creating cherished memories over exceptional food, and we can't wait for our next visit!"

Overall, great indoor and outdoor experience, pretty chic and romantic. The drinks are pretty good, but a bit strong. They have a wide selection of pizzas, portions of pasta, salads, and other small plates. The margarita pizza is pretty tasty, thin, and doughy. It could have been a bit crispier, but still good.

Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Samantha C.,5,7/15/2018,10,PA,"Delicious Northern Italian food...............We have eaten at Spinasse in the Capitol Hill neighborhood twice in the last two months and each time was thoroughly enjoyable. To start, we had the Antipasto Misto which was a taste of each of the appetizers. A great way to taste lots of their dishes. All of the pasta is homemade and I think we have tasted each of their pastas over two visits and have loved all of them. The lamb Agnolotti, which is a ravioli type pasta, is particularly good. Nice wine selection too. Highly recommend."

Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Emily C.,5,8/23/2017,2,WA,"WOW! I was a little intimidated initially look at the menu and not knowing many of the words. When I found out what it was I was a little uneasy. My friend had been here before so she ordered everything for us. Despite my preconceived notions, the food was superb! We started with delicious prosciutto followed by the fried squash. The fried squash was very crispy and complimented the warm and dense ricotta cheese inside. Next we ate beef tongue which fell apart in my mouth. It was very delicious. We ordered the butter and sage pasta as well as the beef/pork ragu pasta. The butter and sage pasta just melted in my mouth. I could have eaten to servings of it. The beef ragu was equally delicious and reminded me of a more gourmet version of Skyline Chili. Lastly, we enjoyed the rabbit meatballs. They were well seasoned and tender. I would come back and order everything again!! Everything was very very good. I plan to bring out of towners/family here in the future!"
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Sienna S.,5,8/14/2017,6,WA,WOW!!! I was blown away by this place. I was a little concerned when I looked at the menu because I didn't understand half the words and the ones that I did looked a little scary...(ground liver??). I was pleasantly surprised with everything I had. My friend did all the ordering for us and I couldn't say anything bad as each dish was better than the last! The ground liver paste on a cracker was surprisingly delectable. The butter and sage noddles melted in my mouth. Next time I want to try the rabbit meatballs!!
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Niki M.,5,08/03/2017,4,CA,My favorite restaurant in Seattle!

We moved to Seattle a year ago and while we have found a lot of great restaurants, Cascina Spinasse continues to be a favorite. The service is warm but professional and the setting is great. Regarding the food, just simple, fresh, amazing dishes. The pasta with butter is as great as everyone says but we've loved everything we've tried there. Great neighborhood spot (and we travel from Bellevue to dine there)."
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Amy L.,5,08/06/2016,48,WA,"This was my favorite restaurant we visited while in Seattle! We were late arriving to our reservation due to traffic (like an hour late) and they couldn't have been more gracious and accommodating. We were greeted with an incredible amuse bouche that was out of this world. The restaurant is charming and quaint, the music is perfect, the dining room volume perfect, the lighting perfect, the table spacing perfect. It has an old world Italian cafe meets slightly Seattle industrial feel going on. The restaurant is not pretentious in the least! Their open kitchen offers peek a boo views into what looks like a movie set... pasta station with fresh ravioli being made, all with rustic mood lighting instead of sterile and fluorescent bulbs. The service was elegant, restrained, yet casual and personable. Everyone's food was incredible. Several decided it was the best Italian dish they'd ever had. The dessert was unreal.. Get the blackberry chocolate... It will rock your world with utterly perfect simplicity. The bar has 8 or so open seats... when we come back we'll head straight there for drinks and better views of the action. And of course more mind blowing food."

My go-to place for romantic dinners with my boyfriend or fun good Seattle meals to impress out of town guests. The menu continues to get better and better without losing the sage pasta dish.

Spinasse has time and time again impressed me and pleased me. I absolutely love it here."

Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=90,Jeremy M.,5,6/16/2012,3,WA,Don't know where to begin. Will be smiling about this meal for days. I have been bending my fiance's ear about this place since October. Finally got here tonight and it exceeded expectations. It's a Sunday and we got an 8:30 reservation- make sure to call ahead or use Open Table! Our waiter (Luis) was attentive and knowledgeable without being pretentious. He recommended a perfect wine to get us started. The anchovy topped buttered crostini set the tone- simple and spectacular! The little corner table by the window was so romantic. We started with a chickpea insalata with marinated rabbit and homemade mayo- amazing. It went perfectly with the wonderful bread. Next we had the famous butter and sage pasta and a new rabbit sausage pasta primi. For secondi we both had the pork shoulder- braised and slow cooked with anchovy and lemon- good God! There just aren't words. Our server got the rabbit sausage recipe from the chef for us (fiancé makes wild game sausage) and brought me an excellent grappa to finish things out. I could die happy!!! Will be back again and again- next time plan to try the extravagant tasting menu. Believe the hype- this place earns it's five stars in every way.
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cascina-spinasse-seattle?not_recommended_start=90,Loic B.,5,5/27/2012,10,ce,One of the best Italian experiences in Seattle. Amazing service.

These guys are actually Americans which surprised me at first because the entries were unusually special. My expectations were high because of a friend's description. She was here with some friends during a girl night out and recently surprised me with her invitation. My expectations were met.I'm hooked! It's a little pricy but well worth it.
Olmstead,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/olmstead-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Brian P.,3,01/12/2020,106,WA,"Very happy to see something finally open up in the former Broadway Grille location. Absolutely great location.The good:- Food is decent. Better than a diner, not too pretentious, priced reasonably. - Cocktails are great! Menu is a lot more interesting than I expected. Really diverse selection. - Service was fine - I'm sure they're still just getting sorted out.The not-so-great:- Fries could have been cooked a little longer (a tad soggy)- Hamburger bun was soggy-ish - needed to be pre-toasted- My their-take-on-a-Jungle-Bird-but-with-Calvados was a little too _dry_ for what the drink is, which was surprising (used to seeing tiki-ish drinks come out too sweet; this was actually the opposite.) Campari needs to be tamed; about a half teaspoon of simple syrup may have been in order.Overall, though, I'm optimistic about the food and service and think they'll dial it in. However, The bad:The place was barely remodeled from Broadway Grille days; they put some paint, paneling and wallpaper up and that's about it. So what this means is it is extremely loud in this restaurant. While not as bad as some places (I'm still looking at you, Union) I really hope this changes. It makes for an unpleasant dining experience.There are essentially no soft surfaces or acoustical panels at all in their front dining area which means it's mostly concrete and glass. I'm sure it'll be better in the summer when they can open the garage doors but that's only a few months out of the year.The back larger area by the bar has the advantage of height so it's likely less noisy (we didn't dine back there) but still going to be a problem especially if they plan on using the stage.There's a difference between ""festive"" noise levels and ""I literally cannot hear the person three feet away from me on the other side of the table when he speaks at a normal volume"" so I really, really hope you guys get this under control. I shouldn't have to be carrying earplugs with me to a restaurant just to get through my meal without feeling assaulted by the background noise.And yes, this is becoming a cause of mine - this city has a real problem with noise in bars and restaurants but _not everyone_ has the problem to the same degree. Some new restaurants do, in fact, get it right.Overall, though, on the right track and will check it out again in a few months."
Olmstead,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/olmstead-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Nick C.,4,12/27/2019,2,WA,Toasts were great. Nice to see a new promising spot in the old Broadway Grill spot.

Paju,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paju-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Elizabeth R.,2,07/01/2024,3,GA,Had a mimosa here for $6 (6.50 ish if counting tax). Good place to get your food and sit down for a drink in the middle of cravings. Honestly a little pricey for not a full glass (it was more half or 2/3s) I would've liked but overall it was fine.
Paju,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paju-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Sammy B.,4,8/20/2024,55,WA,"We had reservations for dinner, but had to wait and the smoky smell was pretty overwhelming. The service was slow, and we waited a lot. The Octopus dish was too salty, but the Mushroom was great. The Seafood Jeon was good, and I really liked the Sujebi. The ribeye was okay, but nothing special for the price. Overall, it was a pleasant experience, but maybe a bit overpriced."
Paju,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paju-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Amaris C.,4,04/01/2023,22,WA,"Paju is a high-end Korean fusion restaurant that aims to offer a unique dining experience by combining traditional Korean flavors with modern cooking techniques. While I enjoyed my meal at Paju, I have to say that I wasn't blown away by the flavors.The dishes at Paju are beautifully presented and prepared with care. The staff is knowledgeable and attentive, making sure that every guest feels welcome and taken care of. However, I have to admit that the flavors didn't seem to mesh together perfectly in my experience. For example, the squid ink kimchi fried rice was well-prepared and tasted good, but it didn't have that wow factor that I was hoping for. It essentially tasted like a squid ink pasta but with rice and some kimchi thrown in, which was good but not amazing.That being said, I would still recommend giving Paju another try. The restaurant clearly puts a lot of effort into their dishes, and it's possible that other menu items may be more to your liking. Additionally, the atmosphere of the restaurant is upscale and sophisticated, making it a great choice for a special occasion or a night out.Overall, while my experience at Paju was good, I didn't find the food to be amazing. However, I would be willing to give it another try in the future, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high-end Korean fusion dining experience."
Paju,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paju-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Chopard J.,5,11/27/2024,9,WA,"As soon as you approach, the inviting scent of a crackling wood-fire grill instantly brings to mind warm, joyful memories of campfire gatherings--a perfect prelude to the meal ahead. The menu showcases an exciting mix of flavors, and I couldn't help but marvel at the grilled branzino, which was cooked to perfection. Even more impressive was the duck, which arrived with beautifully crispy skin and a rich, succulent taste. The banchan, Paju-style, accompanying these grilled dishes were a delightful and refreshing complement, balancing the flavors perfectly.The bar offers some delicious cocktails. I can't wait to return!"
Paju,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paju-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Michele D.,5,4/13/2024,13,FL,Food was incredible. I enjoyed food I never thought I would! Unique! Service was perfect.
Paju,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paju-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Mark S.,5,01/03/2024,8,WA,"From the moment you step into Paju, you're embraced by an atmosphere that's both modern and welcoming, blending a touch of elegance with the ultimate comfort. It's the kind of place where you instantly feel at ease, yet excited for the culinary journey ahead.Let's dive into their menu, where each dish is a testament to Paju's commitment to quality and innovation. The hamachi crudo, paired with the tartness of granny Smith apples, is a refreshing start, balancing flavors with finesse. The oxtail tacos are a standout - the use of crispy seaweed shells is ingenious, enclosing tender, flavor-packed meat that's nothing short of a taste sensation. And the octopus? It's a triumph in tenderness, matched with a sauce that elevates it to a whole new level of deliciousness. In fact, every dish we tried was a hit, leaving no room for disappointment.Service at Paju is as impeccable as their food. The staff isn't just friendly; they're genuinely enthusiastic about their offerings, guiding you through each dish with knowledge and charm. It's the kind of service that makes a great meal unforgettable.A pro tip for fellow food enthusiasts: visit Paju with a group. Why? Because you'll want to order everything on the menu, and trust me, it's all worth trying. It's a gastronomic adventure that's best shared."

Paju,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paju-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=10,Gail L.,5,8/15/2019,7,WA,Best meal I have ever had! Modern Korean. Chef relocated from a 2 star Michelin rated restaurant in NYC. Great food and atmosphere. Going to bring some other friends back later this week.3 days later....I have now officially tried everything on the menu and there I promise you every dish is over the top fantastic! Chef Jeong knew I was coming back with a friend for her birthday and he made a special dish and cake for her. My son made me promise to bring home the Truffle Bulgogi and Panna Cotta for him which he loved when he was in with me a few days ago. Chef Jeong even accommodated my daughter who is extremely difficult to please and she wanted seconds. My friends who I dined with tonight agree this is the best food they have ever had. I describe it as a party in my mouth one dish after another.
Paju,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paju-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=10,Brooks R.,5,08/12/2019,6,WA,"Wow, what a great addition to the neighborhood! This was a Korean food experience unlike anything I've ever had.I first took note of this place last week while it was still under construction. They had a sign posted in the window advertising ""modern Korean food"", and with Korean being one of my favorite cuisines, I was super intrigued and resolved to stop by next time I was visiting SIFF (it's right around the corner from the Uptown.)Last night was that night and seriously, the food here is unreal. There was only one other table of patrons during my visit so the chef (who's also the owner) came out and chatted with us for a while. He's SUPER nice and apparently he was the chef de cuisine for Jungsik (a 2 Michelin Star Korean restaurant in NYC) before moving out here a couple years ago to raise his kids. Color me impressed.Anyway, back to the food. The menu here is pretty small (there were about 8 dishes) so I think I tried about half of its contents.I started with the Sweet and Spicy Wings. Two things I want to emphasize: 1) the wings are very large and meaty (which more than justifies the $13 for 6 pieces price point), and 2) these are literally the best wings I've ever had. Perfectly cooked, impossibly crispy, and so so so flavorful with just the right amount of kick. This was absolutely the star of the show and I can't recommend it enough.Next up was the Endive Salad. I almost skipped this item because the menu literally just says ""Endive"" as the title of the dish and I didn't realize it was a salad, but the server suggested it and I'm SO glad I tried it. The ingredients were interesting: endive, burrata, sunflower seeds, orange, and a smoked vinaigrette. I've literally never tasted anything like it. It's smoky and citrusy and refreshing all at once. The flavor profile is so complex and I implore any adventurous eaters to give this a try. It's simply wonderful.For the entree, I went with the Truffle Bulgogi. I was hesitant because I think truffle is a little played out as a flavor and usually when a dish incorporates it, it overwhelms the entire dish. I wasn't thrilled about the prospect of having my beef drenched in truffle oil but the server highly recommended it so I figured what the hell? Once again, Paju won me over with this one. The bulgogi is pretty straightforward in terms of what you'd expect flavor-wise but with some nice touches to elevate the dish: rib eye for the beef; crispy quinoa to add a little crunch; beautifully sliced shitake mushrooms on top. It plays really nicely against the truffle, which is much more subtle (thankfully) than I was expecting. The rice was well seasoned (that's not to say it was salty) and much like the salad, all the flavors came together perfectly. My only complaint with this dish is I wanted something to give it a little kick (I like spicy!) I feel like some fresh chilis or spicy kimchi would've sufficed so hopefully they'll find a way to accommodate us fire chasers down the road as they establish themselves.I was stuffed by this point in the meal (which is saying something given my insatiable appetite) and was prepared to call it a night when the kitchen sent out a complimentary Panna Cotta for me to try. Hooooooooly shit it was good! It was served in a cup and topped with a citrusy syrup (grapefruit perhaps?), sliced grapefruit, sweetened granola, and fresh blackberries. You guys. This is the stuff dreams are made of, and I generally don't use hyperbole. It was absolutely unreal.A trip to Paju will cost you a bit more than a standard trip to your neighborhood takeout joint, but they're playing a whole different game over here. It's upscale dining in a casual atmosphere with a hospitable staff and ambitious chef. I've just never had Korean food quite like this. Rachel Yang, you're on notice -- there's a new player in town. If they can hang on long enough to establish themselves, Chef Jeong seems destined to shake the whole game up."

Once inside its an amazing looking little space almost like old Seattle vibe. We ordered the chicken burger and it was pink in the middle twice, Fish tasted like old seaweed, not to mention the kitchen staff didn't even have hair nets!! One of em looked like an Irish butler with his 1940s hat, they must have one of those programs where they hire the homeless. drinks came out extremely odd tasting. When we asked the bartender what was some of the alcohols used were she said "" idk it's my 1st day"". The place doesn't have security so the homeless wonder in aimlessly. Our server told us that a homeless person came in with a Knife last week and cops had to be called while guests restrained him!!! Im not trying to get stabbed while I eat out. It's connected to another bar so the bathroom is shared, homeless people in the bathroom clogging up the toilets and overflowing into the hallway which made the place smell horrible. We asked for a manager but one was not on duty they said. There are better places to eat around town I'd stay far away from this place. -10/10 Dumpster Level"

The oversized empanadas are a force to be reckoned with, packed to the brim with goodness. The Brussels sprouts dish, on the other hand, is a real winner, a taste explosion. Sadly, the wings are forgettable, and the sangria won't make your day. The hot sauce selection sounds intriguing, even though I didn't get to dive into it. As for the black cod dish, it had potential, but it left room for improvement. It's a rollercoaster of tastes, and just when you thought it couldn't get more interesting, a fight breaks out outside - an unexpected twist in this culinary adventure."

The atmosphere was pretty standard for a bar - dim lighting and loud music. The drinks weren't my favorite or anything. I wasn't a fan to be honest. They just taste like straight up alcohol, no flavor in the cocktails. The prices were a bit high.The food at Deadline Bar was also just okay. I tried the garlic parmesan fries and they were pretty standard - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They were served with a side of ketchup. Overall, the fries were nothing special.All in all, I would say that Deadline Bar is a decent spot if you're looking for a place to grab a drink with friends and have never been before. Worth a try. Would I go again? No. The atmosphere is pretty standard, the drinks are not the worst and the food is okay. It's not the best bar I've ever been to, but it's not the worst either.

My wife went for the crispy chicken sandwich, and she couldn't stop raving about how perfectly crispy and flavorful it was.To cap off our meal, we indulged in the habanero caramel cronuts, and wow, what a treat! The combination of sweet and spicy was simply divine, and it's definitely a must-have dessert at Dead Line.Overall, our experience at Dead Line was nothing short of phenomenal.

I had popped into this place a few times on my way to a game or when at a show at the Central and service has always been amazing, and now if I'm near Pioneer Square I make a point to stop into this wonderful establishment. My husband and I even ended up doing a small court wedding and having our reception here in one of their private rooms, The Gold Room. Bar service wise; they had a server that seemed to be completely dedicated to our needs and was very timely on making sure everyone was satisfied. The bar staff even came up with custom cocktails for my husband and I that many of our guests fell in love with. Kitchen wise; I was blown way by the cuisine. My husband being from Mexico originally, it was very important to me to be able to have the most authentic South American cuisine I could get (even if it wasn't Mexican specifically). The kitchen staff far exceeded my expectations by not only being amazing chefs in columbian inspired cuisine but, by asking if there was anything in particular that my husband missed from home. To the point where one of them called their mom asking for a family recipe. Needless to say my husband had food that night that he had not had for 3+ years. The staff in both bar and kitchen made the night extremely easy and unforgettable by the service of phenomenal cocktails and food. For the record the staff members that created this amazing experience where Rich (Event Coordinator), Phillipè (Chef), Tanner (Chef), and Jim (Bartender that was handed our event), and Cody (Bartender)"

Rondo,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/rondo-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Beatrice L.,1,5/30/2021,8,WA,"I heard amazing things about this restaurant. I read all the stellar reviews of this place written by fellow yelpers. I saw all the pictures. I went with high expectations. Maybe it may have been different had we dined in. Who knows, but what I ordered vs what I paid...something doesn't seem right to me. First, the uni ikura bowl. As you can see, the amount of uni in this bowl is ridiculous. Granted, they said it's not uni season and that uni they have are quite small...ok.... but when you charge me $58 for this bowl, I expect a little better. Let me go back on the price of this item. This donburi is originally $38. That's what's listed on the menu. No where on their website or at the restaurant, does it say price will adjust depending on availability. No where does it say it will adjust as we'll be paying market price, but they said they'll have to charge us $58 because it's not uni season. We paid the price thinking we'd at least get what we paid for. What we got is actually not even worth $38. Sorry. I think you could have done a whole lot better Rondo. If this is all the uni you had, maybe you shouldn't be selling any uni dishes, rather than hiking up the price.  Bara chirashi - this was ok. Not as outrageous as the $58 bowl. Was it worth $22? Unsure. Maybe I would have justified it had it not been for the $58 mess. Don't get me wrong. I'm not ranting because I'm cheap. I'll gladly pay $58 ..80..100 IF my food matches what I pay for. But for an establishment that serves many uni dishes, you should have either 1) not sell any after explaining low stock/low availability/ 2) explain low stock/low availability and charge the normal price 3) OR charge $58 and give that much + add something else to the donburi to justify that price."
Rondo,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/rondo-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Rika M.,2,02/06/2022,2,WA,"For lunch, we ate inside the restaurant, but our meal was served in a plastic to-go lunch box.For a lunch costing over $100 for 3, wouldn't it be normal to use proper tableware instead of a plastic to-go lunch box for an in-house meal? It was unpleasant and very disappointing."
Rondo,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/rondo-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Ced C.,2,10/20/2021,103,CA,"For the prices, especially during happy hour, I was really expecting more. I was quite disappointed after having read all the yelp and Google reviews. Hopefully, we just ordered the wrong items during happy hour, at least the wait staff seemed helpful. Their daily menu included a blue fin tuna handroll. We opted for the additional uni since it sounded like it was fresh from Santa Monica. We tried some uni from Santa Monica from another Seattle Japanese restaurant, Kamonegi, and it was extremely fresh. Sadly, we were disappointed with the uni from Rondo as it was either not as fresh or was a bad batch since it apparently came from the same source. The bluefin tuna seemed decently fresh and the ikura seemed pretty fresh. The handroll overall was still decent, perhaps 4/5.The Yuzu Ebi Mayo was 5 pieces of shrimp covered in a mayo mixed sauce over some green spring mix (similar mix from grocery stores). Nothing too special about this one, tasted decent, 2/5.Tasty B.B. Noodle - Uni and IkuraThis dish reminded me of a creamy pasta dish with extra parmesan cheese. There was a bit of uni and ikura in the mix as well. The uni was the same Santa Monica uni from earlier and could be fresher, especially for the price. 2/5.Bara-Chirashi DonburiThis was the reason why we tried this place, and unfortunately, we were disappointed. There were two small thin pieces of wagyu in here which is understood since its not cheap, definitely on the well done side. The wagyu was pretty good, but it was drowned out by the over seasoned rice. The rest of the sashimi seemed to be decently fresh, however, the rice was overly seasoned which drowned out the flavor of the sashimi. The donburi was quite small for the price, especially during happy hour. 2/5.Overall, pretty high price tag for happy hour in Seattle. Was hoping to get swept off my feet as far as quality goes but was disappointed. Who knows, maybe I ordered all the wrong dishes which is why this place has glowing reviews. For now, I don't think I'd return as there are many other happy hour spots to try while in Seattle."

Rainbow Uni Shooter ($9): I loved the combination of uni, ikura, tobiko, quail egg, nori puree, and umami soy on sushi rice. It was like a little meal in a small sake cup. The balance was just right, making it a standout dish.Corn Kara-ge ($7): I'm not entirely sure what is basted in the corn, but it tasted like miso butter to me. It was lightly roasted and had a good savory flavor with the sweet corn kernels. Yum. Uni and Seafood Udon ($24): While a bit on the expensive side, this dish was delicious. My only feedback is that it needed a little more salt and cream sauce, as it was slightly dry.Soft Serve with Miso Caramel ($5): This dessert was delicious! The texture of the ice cream was perfect, and the sweetness level was spot on. My only feedback is that the miso flavor could have been stronger.Overall, I had a great dining experience at Rondo and would definitely return to try their chirashi and bento boxes, which look so tasty!"

I ordered a spicy tuna bowl, and I could choose between chicken or ribs. How I was sort of hungry, I asked fried chicken. The food was very well prepared, the size of the portion was quite big, but the star of the dish was the sauce. It tastes like an authentic homemade Japanese sauce, and the fried chicken was crunch and tasty.Also, the waiter was courteous and pleasant with all of us."

Some standout favorites include Mr. Pork Rib, Chinese-style curry donuts, spicy red ramen (actually, all the ramen!), the curry, and the donburi. Every dish brings the flavor and soul, so satisfying!It's a fantastic spot for couples or larger groups to share and enjoy together. The staff is absolutely amazing--energetic, positive, and genuinely give a damn that you have a great time.The atmosphere is another highlight for me. It's cozy and relaxed, with a lively vibe from a restaurant full of happy folk super satisfied with everything Rondo dishes up.

I love the ambiance and variety of food and drink options... Slightly biased here because I'm a huge fan of their sister restaurant Tamari Bar, which has a very similar atmosphere and menu offerings.The Rainbow Uni Shooters are a must-try burst of umami, creamy butteriness in a single bite. I usually feel indifferent towards the taste of uni, but I would definitely get these shooters again.Also decided to try the Uni Seafood Creamy Udon. It's exactly what it sounds like: a comforting bowl of udon noodles bathed in a creamy white sauce and topped with uni. Adding this to my list of uni dishes I would order again.The Aburi Salmon Battera Sushi was another flavorful bite. The seared salmon melts in your mouth and the smoky flavor compliments well with the rice.For drinks (forgot to take a picture), my friend and I ordered a matcha gin & tonic and a fruity cocktail I'm forgetting the name of. I thought both were pretty good.Overall, solid food and drink flavors and presentation, inviting ambiance, and attentive service!"

No matter how many times I go to Rondo, I will never get tired of it. With constant new daily specials, a loaded happy hour menu, and impeccable menu staples, there is always delight to be found. My personal favorites are the spicy tuna donburi, the premium bento box, and the spicy tuna crispy sushi bites from the happy hour menu! The service is always fast and the presentation is superb. It's perfect for special outings and casual ones as well. Ordering from the happy hour menu makes it fairly affordable for the quality, but even apart from that, Rondo is worth it!!"

It seem like they have a lot of regulars because they knew each other by name and they sat close to the bar. The service was really great!! The food was some of the best I've had. My partner loves curry so he had it along with an Oxtail Ramen. I had katsudon and Tokyo Shoyu Ramen. In my opinion, the bill was a bit pricey but so worth it.

Service was slow, host rude, portions small, and wait way too long. We waited over two hours after trying to call to reserve beforehand but being told that they ""did not do reservations"". After arriving, we were told to join the wait list and would have to wait for at least an hour. By the time we sat down to eat our food, nothing but life-changing ramen could have made this experience better. Unfortunately, this was not life changing."

I went here and got the Shio Rekka Ramen and it was very oily and salty. Was missing a lot and was not very impressed with the meal. There are many other ramen places in the area that I think are better and less wait. I don't know if I'll come back a second time.

The wait outside was a bit long--about 40 minutes--but that's to be expected since the place is pretty popular. While you wait, you pre-order your food on a slip, which streamlines the process once you're seated.Once inside, the food came out surprisingly fast. I ordered the classic ramen with egg and extra chashu, it did not disappoint. The broth was incredibly rich, full of deep, savory flavors, and the noodles were cooked to the perfect texture. The tender, flavorful pork added the perfect touch.Service was excellent--waitstaff were attentive and friendly, making the dining experience enjoyable. The place is on the smaller side, so seating can be a bit tight, but it's definitely worth it for the food. I also noticed they have a stamp reward system, so you can earn free ramen over time, which is a nice bonus.Overall, a really tasty bowl of ramen, and I'd definitely return for another round in the future!"

I ordered Negi Chashu. The soup was not too salty or greasy. Super creamy and pretty mellow compared to other ramen I've had. Light but packed with lots of flavor. The noodles were soft and delicate and paired well with the broth. The chashu was soft and not too greasy so it tasted great with the spicy chutney. Usually a very balanced bowl of ramen that is almost perfect. It's a matter of preference, but I'm sure something like pickled ume would be a welcome addition to this bowl. If it was just the food, Denbo would be the closest to the 5, but like most popular spots around Seattle, you're usually pushed into a small corner and forgotten about because of the restaurant. . . How crowded it was. You might gasp at your neighbor at how full the tables are at this restaurant. There's really no room to walk, pass, or even get in or out of your seat without imposing. I had to flag down the wait staff for water, my order, and then my check. I would recommend Denbo if you want a solid bowl of ramen, just have time to wait for your table, and just want a loud time to hangout with friends."

Also, he added a lot of toppings and the bowl was not big enough to hold the broth to match the toppings. His broth got shallow within a few bite. Compared to his ramen, mine would taste like water.

The gyoza were perfectly crispy on the outside and filled with juicy, savory goodness. The ginger ale added a nice, tangy touch to round off the meal.Every bite was a delight, and the service was top-notch.

Ramen Danbo,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/ramen-danbo-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=30,Anu P.,5,8/21/2023,125,WA,"Ramen lovers, rejoice! let me tell you, this small little gem is an absolute haven for your taste buds. What truly impressed me was the dedication to cater to all types of diners. As a vegetarian, I often struggle to find flavorful options, but Ramen Danbo truly delivered with their veggie ramens. They have a number of veggie offerings.We tried their veggie miso ramen, seasonal tomato ramen and the sesame ramen, and I was blown away by the explosion of flavors in each bowl. you have the option of choosing noodle thickness, richness of broth and a number of other customization. The veggie miso ram had a velvety miso broth. The depth of the flavors was incredible, and the umami notes from the miso took this bowl to a whole new level. The noodles were perfectly cooked, and every bite had perfect texture and flavor. The tomato ramen was an interesting combination but I enjoyed the other two ramens more. It is a seasonal flavor they have. 3.5/5The sesame ramen, oh my goodness, was a revelation. If you like Sesame you will love this broth. The rich nuttiness of the sesame combined with the savory broth was a match made in ramen heaven. my favorite! 5/5Their veggie gyozas are decent too 4/5- had favorful filling and the dough to filling ratio was Pete! The portion sizes were generous. While there was a wait of 60 minutes to get a table, I can wholeheartedly say that the wait was absolutely worth it. However, I must mention that finding parking around the area was a bit challenging. It took some time to locate a suitable spot, but don't let that deter you from the wonderful dining experience that awaits inside.Highly recommend this place for veggie ramen lovers"

Once we got a table and were seated, we were handed the menus and took a look. Aside from ramen they also have other items like gyoza and side dishes.

It's the best ramen I've ever had and now I can't get ramen anywhere else because nothing comes close to Danbo.

We were seated, had our order taken and our food came out all in the span of ~5 minutes. Very fast and efficient service...but they weren't busy at all so we weren't rushed at all.I got the Classic Rekka ramen and my boyfriend got the Classic Chashu-men ramen with extra spice.I love all the options to customize and my thick noodles were cooked perfectly al dente (firm), which I enjoyed. I loved my broth, it was very rich and flavorful. It wasn't that spicy but had a nice flavor. The Chashu ramen broth had a cleaner, sweet flavor. My boyfriend mentioned that although he ordered extra spice his had zero spice, but it wasn't that big of a deal.The bowls/portions were rather small, which they work around by offering extra orders of noodles, but still a good sized meal. (Boiled eggs were also a add on).Overall, would recommend coming here if you want to get a quick tasty meal."

I ordered the classic Rekka ramen, and the broth is probably the best I've had in Seattle.

The staff here is also so friendly, multiple people came to check on our table which was really nice. Will definitely be back!"
Ramen Danbo,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/ramen-danbo-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=60,Tyler K.,5,11/10/2017,7,WA,The spicy miso ramen is amazing. The service was excellent and the staff was super friendly. We kept on getting asked if everything was great and as we finished three staff members took our plates. The best ramen and staff in town! Don't forget to try the gyoza and add the pickled veg to your ramen.
Son of A Butcher,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/son-of-a-butcher-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=0,Josh E.,1,8/30/2020,3,WA,I used to love this place but now I don't know what is going on with them. I ordered 2 item pork belly and sullung tang ( Uber eat )but I didn't receive sullung tang at all and pork belly was not even warm as well as missing stuff. I tried to call them but I wasn't able to contact them.
Son of A Butcher,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/son-of-a-butcher-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=0,Wendy A.,1,08/08/2020,14,WA,I live in the Eastlake area and have eaten here at least six times. But no more after this evening. My husband and daughter and I went in and this was our experience.  We tried to order the chicken dish which we had the last time we dined here. We were told that we needed to order two meals and we could not split them. So we ordered of the pancakes. Our daughter wanted the volcano egg. So here's where I'm going to give the math breakdown.The Chicken dish is $ 18.00The Volcano egg is   10.00The Kimichi Pancake 14.00Our server came back to the table and said we couldn't order that way because we had to order two of the 18.00 dinner items .I then asked if we could just do a take out order instead. She returned and said we could but that the Volcano Egg couldn't be a take out item. I then asked if we could just sit there and my daughter eat the egg dish while we waited. Now mind you this was at 4:30 and there was only one other table in use. We were told we couldn't do that. I then said fine were leaving. I then explained to the manager or who ever he was about why we were leaving. He wanted to explain to me that on the menu it says that there has to be two orders of the chicken dish. So here's the math again. Two Chicken dishes for 18.00 =   36.00One Chicken Dish and One Kimich Pancacke   18.00+14.00=32.00So it was worth him not at least trying to have us stay and eat at his restaurant for $4.00. He needs to learn about customer service. Also not to mention that his server who we would have tipped 20% missed out as well as we are local to this neighborhood and have been trying to support our local restaurants  But not to worry we walked down the street to HayMaker had a great dinner during their happy hour. The service was great they went out of there way to make sure we enjoyed our meal. I will not be returning to Son of a Butcher and will not be taking my family who we were going to go and eat this up coming week.
Son of A Butcher,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/son-of-a-butcher-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=0,Brian C.,2,4/19/2020,3,WA,"Decided to try takeout as I was craving Korean food....not sure if my food had been tampered with, literally looks like togo food someone ate out of. Poor presentation. Their in-dining experience was a lot better. There are better takeout Korean options in Seattle. Overall, I dont recommend.....H Mart food is sadly better quality and for a lesser price. Giving a two star for their effort."
Son of A Butcher,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/son-of-a-butcher-seattle-3?not_recommended_start=0,Seattleite W.,5,1/15/2025,6,WA,"If you're in Seattle and craving the best Korean BBQ experience, this place is an absolute must-visit. It's located in quiet neighborhoods in Eastlake like a hidden jewel box.The highlight of the meal is undoubtedly the Korean BBQ, which features some of the highest quality cuts of meat I've ever had. Their SOB cuts were tender and flavorful, while the pork belly was perfectly crispy on the edges and succulent in the middle. ( one of the best pork belly I ever had in Korean BBQ!! ) Each meat was grilled to perfection right at your table, adding to the interactive and fun dining experience. The quality of the meats is exceptional--tender, juicy, and full of authentic flavors.But the greatness doesn't stop at the BBQ. The seafood pancake (haemul pajeon) is hands down the best I've ever tasted ( everyone in my group agreed ). Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, with generous chunks of seafood. It's the perfect complement to the grilled meats.The side dishes (banchan) here are next level--each one is fresh, vibrant, and packed with flavor. From the crunchy kimchi to the savory pickled vegetables and silky steamed egg, every bite is a delight. The variety of banchan that comes with the meal elevates the entire experience, offering a great balance to the richness of the BBQ.If you're a fan of Korean cuisine, this place is by far one of the best in the Seattle area. Excellent service, top-notch quality, and an unforgettable meal. Highly recommended!"

The meat quality is top notch. I love their sauces and side dishes, they complement the meal perfectly. The servers were very friendly and attentive.

We ordered brisket and pork belly and the pork belly were excellent that we had to order more. The combo comes with soup, steamed egg and they don't disappoint you.We were smart enough to make a reservation this time to avoid long wait so try to make a reservation. Also, keep in mind that they are short of staff so the service can be a little slow. However, the quality of food and side dishes was still amazing."

Staff was friendly and gave me two stickers after I said I'll share on social media. There was no seating so I had to eat it on the way walking around pike place market. I would say it's just regular biscuit and gravy. Probably good for friend/family hang out. If you're a tourist like I am it's definitely better to walk into the market and save your appetite for the local stores there.

We're all running on fumes here and they were so sweet and upbeat, even when people suck and act rude. We ordered at 9am online and checked at the window between walking around to stay occupied. Yes, we knew there was a wait so I was patient. Between 11am-Noon our food must have been sitting around. I walked up to the window and the gal saw it was sitting there and apologized. I got the text that it was ready *after* we got our food. Bit of a bummer because the food was okay, I got a bacon breakfast sandwich and my friend got a basic biscuit w/jam and honey. She thought it was going to be fresh jam but it was a Smuckers to-go one. Grits were....greasy. Coffee was disappointing. I'll try again on a better day."

The biscuits are absolutely divine--crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside. Paired with their locally sourced honey, it's a combo you can't miss. The honey adds the perfect touch of sweetness that takes the biscuits to another level.We also tried one of the plates, but I wasn't as big a fan of it. It felt like just regular scrambled eggs with gravy and grits on top, nothing too exciting. Still, the biscuits alone are worth the visit, and I'd definitely recommend stopping by just for those!"

Biscuit Bitch,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/biscuit-bitch-seattle?not_recommended_start=90,Ellie C.,4,02/07/2018,3,WA,Oysters were good with great selection but had shell bits in them. The food was totally worth the price. The service was excellent.
Biscuit Bitch,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/biscuit-bitch-seattle?not_recommended_start=100,Mike S.,4,02/05/2018,4,CA,Most people don't know there is a another location#. It is over in Belltown. If you miss when it is open here you should definitely go there. There is a more touristy place that is similar over and Pike Place market but this is the one you want to hit! Your belt might take a hit so walk it off in lovely Seattle and head over to the sculpture garden on a sunny day or take first Avenue if it is cloudy. By first Avenue I mean just walking through Belltown. Lovely.
Biscuit Bitch,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/biscuit-bitch-seattle?not_recommended_start=100,Mike M.,4,1/19/2018,31,FL,The food breakfast was great!! Wish they had more space to sit and eat. The place was packed and although I hated to eat standing up it was almost worth it
Biscuit Bitch,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/biscuit-bitch-seattle?not_recommended_start=100,Cody C.,4,1/19/2018,113,WA,"Cool spot for some hot breakfast foods.Located within the Café Lieto, the establishment has that hole-in-the-wall vibe. Limited seating and a overall small space so keep that in mind. The service was great. Everyone seemed like they wanted to be there and were overall friendly.Food was tasty! Fluffy biscuits, endless grits, and hot sausages. Prices aren't too bad. Portions are big. Overall: a good spot for some hot comfort food and coffee. I would recommend more as a grab-and-go because it really doesn't have that much seating."

But I guess that's what happens when you go to places that are #trendy, right? Lol. Anyway , the food's pretty good! Not exactly sure if they're 100% worth the wait, but I'm happy I tried it at least once. I got the Straight Up Bitch (with vegetarian gravy because I'm on a ""diet"") and it was delicious!

Dear I say that they are better than my dear departed Nana's, yes they are. I have not had a biscuit and sausage sandwich this good in a very long time. This was my first time eating here but definitely not my last."
Biscuit Bitch,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/biscuit-bitch-seattle?not_recommended_start=130,Kenneth P.,4,9/19/2016,7,WA,Not as tasty if delivered. Better if you eat it on the spot. Overall good food.
Biscuit Bitch,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/biscuit-bitch-seattle?not_recommended_start=130,Enrique R.,4,09/10/2016,14,WA,"always a line at this place in the downtown location. So if you can make it to the Belltown location might be a little bit easier. A lot of calories, but hey you're on vacation so why not indulge? The coffee is good too. Way better than Starbucks. And the staff has fun attitude. Be careful to check the hours before you go. They close early."
Biscuit Bitch,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/biscuit-bitch-seattle?not_recommended_start=130,Julie M.,4,8/27/2016,18,WA,"Stumbled upon this small spot one morning in search of breakfast. It was really crowded and had a long line but I decided to brave it. They have a small, eclectic menu. I had a biscuit sandwich because it seemed the obvious choice for a first-timer. The biscuit was great but had a little too much of the special house sauce. I'll prob skip the sauce altogether next time. I've heard if you go at off times that the line is shorter too."
Biscuit Bitch,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/biscuit-bitch-seattle?not_recommended_start=130,James A.,4,8/18/2016,3,WA,First time here. I saw them on Facebook and the name got my attention. In and out without any problems. Tasty!

I don't know if I would be eating this type of food all the time. It was a bit greasy and had lots of calories but I think once is okay to try. The place had a different atmosphere than I'm used to but it was okay overall. The food was decent. My friend recommended this place and I was a bit doubtful because of the name but I think everyone should try it once and experience it.

Biscuit Bitch,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/biscuit-bitch-seattle?not_recommended_start=140,Mark H.,4,02/01/2016,5,WA,Food is really good. People are usually really rude. But you kind of expect that based on the name.

Its a hipster type of a resturant. Food is pretty good. Wide variety of things to choose from. One thing I didnt like was how packed it was and there is no place for you to sit down and eat. You have to go down the block to go eat. Id come back again.

Despite their lack of indoor seating, ordering online and picking up at the door was a breeze. The long line outside was a testament to what was awaiting inside.We tried the hot mess bitch - and oh boy, it did not disappoint. The smothering of gravy was just the way I like it, and the portion size was more than enough for my wife and I to share. We were full before we even finished the whole thing!The staff, while unconventional, were an absolute delight. Expect a good-hearted cuss word or two, adding a unique and fun touch to the morning atmosphere. There's nothing quite like being talked dirty to in the early hours - it certainly set the tone for a fantastic day. We'll definitely be back for more."

I had the vegetarian sandwich option which comes with a Morningstar sausage. I will say I wish they had more options for customization. I prefer to eat egg whites, but there are no sub options. Also, all orders are done online. They have a sign outside of the restaurant door which advises how long the wait is for food. There is no indoor sitting, but there a few tables located outdoors. I suggest for you to order online before you get there. You will receive a text and email when your order is ready."

I heard so much about this place and we kept seeing the long lines every morning. Biscuits Bitch gives you a great vulgar experience starting from the name all the way to picking up your food. Want to party at 8am? Come on in. Twerk music to get playing to get your day started. Everyone is so friendly however, ""bitchy"" (lol) at the same time. The top seller, Gritty Scrambled Cheesy Bitch, included biscuit and gravy, eggs, cheese, and grits. I added the country sausage to help make things a little more groovier. The prices vary depending on what you want or what you want to add. There is not a lot of space to eat. You literally have to stand and eat or claim your table fast (we got lucky). Get there early for a good spot! PS: When you check in on yelp, you get a free sticker (if you know me, you know I love stickers!). [Review 94 for 2019. Review 536 overall]"

Of course as soon as they open, there's a line out of the door, but it goes by pretty quick. I love how everything is super ""bitchy"" themed. This sass filled cafe has a variety of biscuit dish options.We ended up getting a Smokin' Hot Bitch, which is a biscuit and gravysmothered in cheese and topped with a Grilled Louisiana hot link, eggs and jalapenos. Since the plate already seemed heavy enough, I opted for no cheese. Everything was sinfully delicious and the portions were so huge that I just couldn't finish it.

Even when there's a considerable wait, it's worth it. I recommend supporting this local business so they can hopefully grow to serve more patrons at a time.The food was so delicious. I ordered the Straigh-up bitch, and I was a little skeptical because I had never had gluten free anything. It was so tasty and it hit the spot just right. The customer service is some of the best I have experienced. They were so kind and family friendly. I think her name was Virginia, but she was super kind and it felt genuine.

Good old fashioned southern-style cooking with modern twists (the vegetarian gravy option, made with shiitake mushrooms and smoked salt for example). The sausage gravy is rich and flavorful, and the biscuits have just the right balance between density and fluffiness. Take into account your other late night options (hot dogs) and Biscuit Bitch becomes the cream of the crop! And it looks like plenty of people agree: downtownseattle.komonews…"
Shaker + Spear,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/shaker-spear-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,D D.,1,10/25/2022,109,CA,"Never felt so discriminated in my life. This place is the absolute worst! Management you need to do better about your establishment! This place discriminates and for no reason We are visiting Seattle from SoCal. We are of Asian decent. Our family joining us were visiting Seattle for the first time. They are military and moving to Japan tomorrow. They are African American and they wanted to try Shaker + Spear as their last meal in America. We all walked in as you can see from outside that there were empty tables. We were a party of 6. The white hostess looked at us and basically said she doesn't have a table to accommodate us and that she won't have any for the rest of the night. My group consisted of 3 adults and 3 children. There was a table right in front of her that accommodated more than 6 people. She said I can recommend somewhere a bit more ""casual"". I didn't understand what she meant by that as we were just as casual as she was, along with other people in that restaurant. She then proceeds to call on another guy saying what's that one Mexican place that you recommend? The guy looked confused as he was like it's Italian. She then proceeds to name other places that we had no desire to eat at. We hear of this happening all the time to other people and today, this ignorant POS wanted to give us that experience. Does this establishment not accept kids? Is there a dress code to eat here?Do you have to be of a certain race to be allowed to eat here?Are we, as tourists, not allowed to dress casual in jeans, pea coats, and Nikes, to feel comfortable in the rainy Seattle weather as we are sightseeing? Is this attire just not acceptable to eat at this establishment?Do you just judge people as if we look like we can't afford to eat there? Whatever her ignorant reasons were, we all felt discriminated by this white chick. Then to top if off, as we were exiting, one of our kids was approached by another white ignorant idiot. My nephew had a boot on as he broke his leg in an accident. This idiot decides to ask my nephew hey kid what did you do to get that boot? Was it something stupid or smart? He's like there's only one right answer but I bet you that you did something stupid right?I was like wtf are you f-ing kidding me right now?! What kind of idiot talks like to this a child??!! Man this place sucks! F this POS racist place!"

We yelled back, yes!After being seated across from each other, we had to yell to hear each other. Food and service may be great, but acoustics are so bad we left before ordering."

The cook on the black cod was perfect though, and the flavors worked well together. Maybe they could add a puree of some type to make it more substantial."
Shaker + Spear,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/shaker-spear-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,David R.,3,6/15/2022,14,WA,"Nice location and atmosphere. Service was good. Scotch Olives as appetizers, really no flavor. Wife had the braised short ribs and really like it, especially thought the sauce was very tasty. I had the Seafood Paella, which I thought didnt have much flavor."
Shaker + Spear,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/shaker-spear-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Jake M M.,4,12/04/2023,3,WA,"Had a chance to dine at Shaker + Spear and it was quite the experience! I tried their Dungeness Crab and Shrimp along with the Steelhead. Each dish was a showcase of flavor and freshness - the seafood was cooked just right, bringing out its natural taste. The ambiance of the place adds a nice touch, creating a cozy yet upscale dining atmosphere. Service was attentive and friendly, adding to the overall positive experience. A solid four-star spot for seafood lovers!"
Shaker + Spear,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/shaker-spear-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Eric T.,4,11/02/2023,17,WA,"I visited this establishment for breakfast and opted for the shaker hangover, a dish featuring fried chicken perched atop a biscuit with gravy and crowned by a fried egg. It proved to be quite delightful. The biscuit had a rich, buttery taste, and the chicken was expertly fried. As you might expect, it's a hearty meal, and the name suits it perfectly.Securing a reservation for a 10 AM Saturday morning visit was a breeze, and it seemed like we could have easily walked in as well, as the restaurant was not overly crowded. The service we received was of good quality.While their breakfast menu is somewhat limited, I found myself intrigued by some of their seafood offerings, so I may return to explore the dinner options in the future."
Shaker + Spear,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/shaker-spear-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Riley J.,4,9/15/2023,5,WA,"Recently visited Shaker + Spear for both brunch and dinner on separate occasions. Tried a variety of dishes, and while everything was prepared well, I felt the flavors were standard for the price point. The ambiance is nice, and the service was attentive. It's a solid choice if you're in the Belltown area, though I was hoping for something a bit more unique in terms of taste. A respectable 4 stars for the overall experience."
Shaker + Spear,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/shaker-spear-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Violet J.,4,09/11/2023,1,WA,"Absolutely loved this restaurant. Excellent service and food.

Shaker + Spear,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/shaker-spear-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=10,Jessica P.,4,3/31/2019,302,IL,"Very good food. Slightly overpriced. It's inside of a hotel, so you're paying a ""we have you captive"" tax. We came here for brunch. I had the trout Spread and homemade crackers and my husband had the crab cake Benedict which features the cakes as the muffins. This is a great idea! Yum. He had a cappuccino which ran $6, and I had a $4 tea. Both were alright, but definitely not worth those costs. If you're charging $6 for coffee it better be something to write about and not in the way that I'm currently doing it. The trout was awesome. In a city with so many options, this was good, but not worth the rating it currently has. The service was great. Hosts and servers super accommodating. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could."

Shaker + Spear,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/shaker-spear-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=10,Tonekia P.,5,12/20/2024,184,GA,"We visited Shaker + Spear while in Seattle, and I'm so glad we did! From the moment we walked in, the service was impeccable--attentive without being overbearing, and everyone made us feel right at home. We started with the octopus appetizer, and let me tell you--it was fantastic. Perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor, it had just the right balance of tenderness and char. Every bite was a delight. For our main course, we split the burger, and it did not disappoint. Juicy, perfectly seasoned, and accompanied by fresh toppings that elevated the dish. Even splitting it, we found it to be satisfying and well-portioned. The ambiance was also worth mentioning--modern yet cozy, with a great vibe that complements the stellar food and service. If you're in Seattle and looking for a spot with top-notch food and excellent service, Shaker + Spear should definitely be on your list. Highly recommend!"
Shaker + Spear,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/shaker-spear-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=10,Chopard J.,5,6/17/2024,9,WA,"After eyeing this seafood restaurant for a while, I finally decided to give it a try-and what a delightful experience it turned out to be! I don't typically indulge in seafood, but every bite tonight was a revelation. The cauliflower steak was simply delicious, and the roasted pepitas added a fantastic crunch that elevated the dish. Despite my usual preference for fully cooked salmon, I thoroughly enjoyed the medium rare preparation, which paired perfectly with the squash and pickled watermelon. As a side, the brussels sprouts were a tad spicier than expected, but the combination of flavors was absolutely amazing. Overall, I can't praise the dishes I enjoyed tonight enough; the flavor profiles were outstanding and truly memorable.The dining area is small, so I would recommend making reservations to ensure you get a table. This restaurant exceeded my expectations in every way, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit to explore more of their enticing menu."

Morgan, the floor supervisor was very attentive and friendly and made sure that all my requests had been taken care of. The food is really fresh and flavorful, most of it bought from local vendors.

The waitstaff were not attentive or friendly, and you were left feeling neglected and unimportant. It's important for any restaurant, particularly one that charges a premium price, to provide exceptional service to its customers.Firstly, the quality of the food provided was not up to your expectations. It's disappointing when you go to a barbecue restaurant and the meat isn't cooked to perfection or isn't of high quality. This is especially frustrating considering that you're paying a premium price for the food.Our experience at Ishoni Yakiniku was not a good one. The combination of mediocre food and poor service left you feeling dissatisfied and disappointed. While it's possible that others may have had a better experience, based on your own experience, it's hard to recommend this company to others."

The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice. However, given the price I honestly expected better quality of meat.The food itself was good, but not exceptional. Overall, it was a decent experience, but not one I would rush to repeat. If you're looking for a Japanese BBQ, there are probably better options in the area."

Ishoni Yakiniku,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/ishoni-yakiniku-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Alec B.,4,9/19/2024,3,CA,Overall I think the food is good and for the promotional price it was worth it but the normal price might be too expensive for what we had.The meat was well seasoned and the variety was good. I think the cuttlefish was the standout option.The only really weird thing I noticed was that the set salad that was using Costco salad mix. The dressing was good but could have been better.
Ishoni Yakiniku,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/ishoni-yakiniku-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Alice W.,4,9/19/2024,1,WA,Food is great! I've been this place for a few times now.

The variety and quality of the cuts were impressive--from tender wagyu to flavorful short ribs, every bite was mouthwatering.The interactive experience of grilling your own meat at the table added a fun and engaging element to the meal, allowing us to cook the beef just how we like it. The marinated beef was packed with flavor, and the sauces provided complemented the meat perfectly.The atmosphere was lively but not too loud, which made it a perfect spot to enjoy with family.

Every table was full and it was very lively with music playing but not excessively loud.We each got their Flash Deal meal set (disclosure: posting a review entitles you to a discount on the set) as well as a Mentaiko seafood udon (limited 20 servings a day on Tues/Wed/Thurs) and they were both awesome. The set comes with a large variety of meats with beef, pork, and calamari as well as side dishes like rice, salad, and kimchi. The meat was all fresh and well marinated and tasted great. I recommend the udon if you're a fan of mentaiko and it's still available. The servers were really nice and came by multiple times to change our grill grate and fill our waters. They also helped us store a birthday cake in the fridge and gave us plates and a cake slicer to celebrate.The grill itself is somewhat small so it may get cramped at times for four people but that just gave us more time to eat and chat. Overall we had a great experience and will come back in the future :)"

When you walk in, you're greeted by a mariachi band playing ""Beethoven's 5th,"" because nothing says ""fiesta"" like classical music! You would be remiss to live life without trying the Vacio and asking for a side of flour tortillas with their unique salsa sampler. Cocktails leave a little to be desired.

We ordered Wylarah wagyu and Japanese A5 filet. They are the most expensive wagyu on the menu(not sure if there's any hidden menu for better choice) The meat is great. I saw from the review from others saying it's overcooked and IT IS! Luckily I ordered rare for the fillet and it's great! Try to order with one lower level of doneness. This restaurant is not for fine dining, smoky(from the steak cooking board) and noisy. Those are fine for me.One thing I dislike: the cooking board is very hot and cooking the meat so oil splash everywhere.... I have it on my clothes and my hands and arms... it last for like 5 minutes before we couldn't stand it and asked for a players remove the meat from the hot stone board."

Has oysters as app and they were perfect.Filet and lamb chops is what we got and both were as good as any steakhouse I have been.  I have been to many. The service made the place it was outstanding.  Only reason not 5 stars is slightly pricey.  But compared to other steakhouses it is a bit more reasonable. I can handle paying as long as it is good. This place was worth it.

Asadero Ballard,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/asadero-ballard-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,Josef S.,5,10/19/2023,27,NJ,"From the moment I walked into Asadero Ballard, I was met with the inviting aroma of grilled meat that immediately transported me to a world where culinary craftsmanship and tradition come together in harmony. The pièce de résistance of the night was, without a doubt, the ribeye steak.Every bite of the ribeye promised an explosion of flavors - a symphony of smokiness that was neither overpowering nor understated, perfectly complementing the inherent richness of the meat. The tantalizing smoky flavor, reminiscent of age-old grilling techniques, brought forth memories of rustic barbecues, and yet, it was served with an elegance that is befitting of a fine dining experience.Accompanying the steak was a baked potato that deserves its own accolade. Fluffy on the inside, with a crisped, golden exterior, it was the ideal counterpart to the hearty steak. It was as if the potato had been baked to perfection, capturing the essence of earthiness and comfort in every morsel."

Asadero Ballard,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/asadero-ballard-seattle?not_recommended_start=40,Josh B.,5,8/25/2023,202,MI,"Overall, this Latin steakhouse provided a phenomenal dining experience. The cuts of meat were some of the best I have ever seen. The restaurant had a quaint outside setting, and we were seated right away. Our server, Samuel, was fantastic and attentive to our drink and food requests.To start, we ordered the guacamole, which was super fresh and served with crispy house-made tostadas and bread. The fire-roasted jalapeño stuffed with cheese and bacon was delicious, but the standout was the chorizo cheese dip, which was the best of the three appetizers.The salsa they provided was fantastic and had a spicy kick to it. It added an extra layer of flavor to the meal.Since there were seven of us, we decided to share the Australian Wagyu tomahawk and the World of Filet Wagyu, which included American Wagyu, full-blood Australian Wagyu, and Miyazaki Japanese A5. The combination of these different types of Wagyu beef couldn't get much better.As for the sides, the fire-roasted poblano peppers with corn were fantastic, and the charred broccoli was exceptional as well.We were so full from the main course that we decided not to order dessert, but overall, the dining experience at this Latin steakhouse was outstanding."

I had been your fan for a long time back from your beginning in Kent where most of your clientele was Mexicans and a few people knew about your great carne Asada tacos hence even back in those days they had only like 5 items .. all great though but i decided to visit your new location in Ballard , it was a nice experience it was like watching your kids go to college or something like that I don't have kids lol but that most be the feeling about seeing a business and grow up to bigger leagues , well on the food I tried the tenderloin tacos my friend got the already traditional carne Asada great as always service needs a little work , my check took longer than normal to get but it's all good it's a new restaurant and we understand that they have stuff to work out overall a great experience."

The weird thing is the location though the family that runs this place are super nice and friendly I don't know why they decided to expand to Ballard ? When most of their customers are Latinos looking for the real thing and not hipsters looking for trendy rip off places that sell organic water and weird stuff like that ... This is as real as it gets its like eating in a asadero from Hermosillo Sonora lovely ! The rib eye tacos cooked to order and the massive carne Asada they don't mess around with portions and we north Mexicans love that ! I just wish them the best in such a difficult location open a place where your people appreciate your food I just don't see them cutting it in Ballard but I still wish them a good business and will support them as much as we can but remember that it's us Norteños that love your food !!! .

Usually have a great experience. Whoever was the hostess tonight made me never want to return. I walk in at 10:25 to be seated and am told their kitchen closes at 10:30. Which is odd cause I've never been told this especially cause I only order oysters and a few drink around this time and day. Needless to say I won't be back.
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,emily c.,1,10/11/2023,1,WA,"I am still reeling from shock of how horribly myself and my family were treated. I, visibly pregnant, was seated at a table with a bench on one side and 2 chairs on the other. My 2yo and 5yo were both sitting with me on the bench side waiting for my husband to arrive. There were 3 other similar tables next to us, all still unseated. The hostess kindly brought us crayons for my children to color on the paper laid across the table. My daughter was coloring, never straying once from our table. My son was guardian of the crayons. On three occasions, my *near 2yo* screamed loudly ""MINE!"" when my daughter went for a crayon. I am well aware this is less than ideal. It is a phase he is in, screeching any time he is excited or mad or expressing emotions. Before and after each of those moments, he was calm and happy and just fine. Each time he did it, I did my best to get him to stop immediately. We had been there all but 10 minutes. The manager, Christopher Fischbach, approached me and said ""You are going to have to reign this in."" I asked ""excuse me?"" And he said ""you are going to have to reign this in. We can't have your children running around and the screaming will have to stop."" I replied that my daughter hadn't left the table once and then asked how he suggest I stop my not yet 2yo son from screaming?"" He said he didn't know. I asked ""and what if I can't? Will we be escorted out?"" And he said ""if it is excessive, maybe so. We have to seat these other tables.""At this point I was so incredulous, I could not believe this was being said to a paying customer, let alone the fact that a child was being targeted. I asked if this was routine for them, he did not reply and he walked away. I still cannot believe this happened. I am appalled. I am ashamed to say that we stayed, but I refuse to be bullied. Yeah, they got my money, but I have my dignity. And I hope Christopher (who, no, does not have children of his own) treats families trying their absolute best with the respect they deserve moving forward. He was a pretty massive disappointment to humanity tonight.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money here. The food was not remotely worth what they lack entirely in service."

As you've probably gathered, my partner is a transgender woman and I fully support/love her, we were eating at the Old Spaghetti Factory in Southcenter when my partner said she felt someone staring at her, I was going to assure her that kno one was staring, however, I was appalled to see this kid working there standing in the kitchen entrance pointing at her, I stared the kid down until he walked away. I immediately asked for the manager, the manager who came over to help us was completely drunk, he asked us if we were sure he was pointing at us, and he offered to pay for our food.

We arrived at 6:50 and were turned away saying that there is no space for us ( there was plenty of space as we could see) We were told there was a burlesque showing going on later in the evening in the back.

I have been to the pink door for many many years and for many occasions, however on this particular occasion we were celebrating 2 birthdays. We enjoyed a very nice lunch for two, linguine vongole and the squid ink pasta seafood special.The awkward moment arrived when the server brought us an empty plate with two birthday candles absent of anything except the two candles.We felt as though he presented an ""empty"" birthday wish. I am still dumbfounded by the gesture. Honestly I would have preferred no recognition rather than the empty plate presentation. That was the one star reception we received.

The problem was the cost of the food for the quantity and quality. We really went to see the perfomace thinking it would be a fun way to spend dinner. Well the performace is five minutes at best, every 30-45 minutes so don't go for that. The food was way over priced. I spent $44.00 for a small bowl of (premade) gluten free pasta with a bland cream sauce, a butterscotch pudding (which was pretty good) and a glass of water-yes $44!!! . Since I had to eat GF I didn't get bread unless I wanted to pay $3 more for Udi's bread. There were no dinner salads, veggies, meat for my dish or anything else. I hate the Italian Denny's (Olive Garden) but have to say I have had better meals there and for a better price. Felt a bit duped by the allure of a cool performace which is the only reason I was willing to spend that kind of money on pasta only to find out it the performance wasn't really part of the ambiance. Very disappointing."

The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=10,EmmLee W.,1,9/16/2013,8,WA,"We planned our meal two months in advance, reserved a table, and hoped to top off the last night of our Seattle vacation with an excellent view, meal and drinks.We were seated on the patio, jammed into a corner but jutting out into the walkway, where we were jostled by staff and other diners. We ordered sodas while taking a moment to look at the wine menu, and decided to share an order of the calamari with spinach. This was okay, a bit overcooked and chewy, but we had high hopes for the meal - I ordered linguine with clams, and my husband ordered clams and mussels.I had one bite of my pasta with clams, and couldn't eat anymore. The pasta was overcooked, but all of that was masked by the amount of sodium in the ""broth"" - you could taste nothing BUT salt, as though a cup of it had been poured into the cooking liquid. The acidity burned my tongue and scoured the inside of my mouth. I couldn't taste or eat properly for two days afterward. My husband's clams and mussels had no seasoning or taste, other than that of steamed and overcooked seafood. No garlic, wine, herbs or anything else. It was as if they'd steamed the shellfish and dumped them in the bowl. Also, no pasta or other sides were served with that dish: $26 or so for a bowl of flavorless steamed mussels and clams. We declined to order something else, and asked for our check. This was the only time in our lives that we've ever walked out of a restaurant. Although the manager comped our soda and calamari, we left a comparable amount on the table for the waitress and staff. We figured they shouldn't be left without the tip they'd have received had the chef and kitchen staff not put out such an embarassing ""meal"". We spent an hour trying to find another restaurant that was open in the area after 9 PM, which oddly enough is not easy to do, especially as we'd walked from our rental to The Pink Door.As far as ambience and staff: the greeter and our waitress were very nice. The place was okay, but other than some cute decoration and a good band, it wasn't exceptional - certainly not enough to balance out the mediocre starter and inedible meal. I can honestly say I'd not recommend this restaurant to anyone."

After reading the rave reviews, I was excited to check it out. I ordered the seasonal Love Fest drink and the spinach pasta lasagna. Both were absolutely delicious--the best lasagna and cocktail I've ever had. Despite it being pretty packed and not having a reservation, the host kindly offered me a seat at the bar. I didn't mind since I was dining solo. The bartender was very friendly and made me laugh as we chatted about San Francisco, my hometown. The ambiance was charming, with a dark yet cozy interior and live music, which was a lovely bonus.Fast forward to my second visit, which was during my birthday weekend on a solo trip to Seattle. I decided to have my birthday dinner at The Pink Door. Unfortunately, this experience was vastly different. I arrived around 8 PM, close to the last call for dinner, so the restaurant was quite empty. Despite this, the host insisted I sit at the bar again, which felt odd since there were plenty of empty tables and I wanted a more traditional dining experience for my birthday. I ordered an orange cocktail (can't remember the name), and while the waitress carded me, she didn't acknowledge my birthday at all. Additionally, my water cup was only refilled by a passing busser rather than my waitress, who seemed inattentive. The lasagna was just as delicious as before, but the service this time was extremely disappointing. It felt like they weren't interested in providing good service during the last call.The food at The Pink Door is amazing, but the service can be hit or miss. They definitely need to improve their service, especially for customers who dine during quieter times."

Our server and the overall service on the other hand was less than subpar and rude at times. I came here with my girlfriend knowing I was going to spend a few hundred dollars and we were taken to our seat and immediately told by our young male server that when he is in our presence we have to put our masks on which I am 100% on board with preventative measures regarding covid however when im in a restaurant sat across from one person while our server is 6ft apart it didn't make sense but we went with it. Putting his unapproachable attitude to one side, we literally had to wait close to 20 minutes to even order our first drink which again showed either his lack of understanding in the customer service industry or lack of respect to his patrons. I know he isn't a true representation of this establishment because of the many other great reviews but when youre spending hundred of dollars on a meal, the environment and service should be a solid part of the package and this was lacking. I have been to nearly 8 restaurants over my vacation here in Seattle and this guy ruined what would be an amazing 5 star place. Would not recommend to friends or family."

My wife and I were really looking forward to going and we thought it was a bit of a classy place, judging by the website. Turns out, it's not. Luckily for us, we got to sit inside, but the tables outside all had plastic picnic type table cloths. The restaurant is located in an alley and it fits in with the Public Market scene, but definitely not with the classy scene that it portrays on the website. The food wasn't that great either, ESPECIALLY for the price we paid. I had the spaghetti, which came with no garlic bread or anything and my wife had the steak, which was more bone than actual meat. The main reason we wanted to go was for the trapeze artist, which was supposed to be performing from 6:30-9PM, so I made our reservation for 6:30PM. The whole hour and a half that we were there, she performed for 2 songs. That's it! The trapeze artist isn't something that should be advertised if she isn't going to perform. Overall, I definitely won't be returning to The Pink Door. It's just not worth the money. It's nothing spectacular."

While my experience had its highlights, there were a few aspects that left me wanting more.Let's start with the positives. The service at The Pink Door was exemplary. From the moment I stepped through the pink-hued entrance, the staff greeted me with warm smiles and made me feel welcome. They were attentive, knowledgeable, and ensured that my dining experience was smooth and enjoyable. Kudos to the staff for their exceptional service!The drink selection at The Pink Door was a true delight. The bar is well-stocked and the mixologists behind it know their craft. I tried a couple of their signature cocktails, and each one was expertly crafted, bursting with unique flavors and beautifully presented. If you're a fan of creative libations, The Pink Door will not disappoint.Now, onto the food. While the dishes at The Pink Door were undeniably well-prepared, I found them to be on the pricier side. It's true that quality ingredients and a skilled culinary team come at a cost, but I couldn't help but feel that the prices were a tad steep for what was served.Specifically, the pasta, often hailed as an Italian staple, left me somewhat underwhelmed. While it was cooked to a perfect al dente texture, the flavors fell slightly short of my expectations. The dishes lacked that extra oomph that elevates a good pasta to a memorable one. Perhaps a bit more attention to seasoning and innovative flavor combinations would enhance the overall dining experience.Despite these shortcomings, The Pink Door does possess its fair share of merits. The attentive service and the remarkable drinks are definite highlights that shouldn't be overlooked. However, I would encourage the restaurant to refine their flavors and consider adjusting their pricing to offer better value for the culinary experience they aim to provide.In summary, The Pink Door is a decent Italian restaurant with good service and amazing drinks. While the food may be a bit expensive and the pasta lacks a little bit of flavor, it's still a place worth visiting if you're in the mood for a charming atmosphere and attentive service."

The interior is fun and whimsical.The reception we received at the front desk was lukewarm. Our server seemed to be having a bad day. Not bad service, just no warmth or personality. The cocktails were on the lower end of OK. The food was good, not great. The whole thing was just OK. I think if the hostess had seemed happy we were there, it would have started us on a better track. We wouldn't go back, but I guess it's worth one visit."

Hidden in an alley near Pike Market and only identifiable by their signature pink door, this restaurant feels like stepping into an old vaudeville theater. When we went, there was a live band with an amazing vocalist playing blues/Americana music. The pasta was good but the dishes could've used more sauce that was a consensus from all. The prices are affordable that's for sure. We stayed for a few hours, enjoyed the food, atmosphere, jazz band and company. The service could've been quicker but the waitress was extremely nice and knowledgeable. There's no reason why I wouldn't go back."

We found it by chance and it really does have a nondescript pink door. But when you walk inside, you get the feeling of warmth, history and elegance. The food was fantastic and they easily accommodated my no grain eating challenges. Their house infused olive oil was out of this world. We had filet of sole and a butternut squash risotto with shrimp. Could not have been better. We wanted to keep eating because it was so good but were full! Wait staff was friendly and attentive. Live music was fun on a Saturday night. We will be back!"

The environment was so good with delicious aromas of foods spread all over. Our ordered food was served so well and it was so appealing to my taste buds. Our server was very friendly.

Had the lobster ravioli and the eggplant pasta for course. The administration was brisk, the server helped us pick sustenance. We finished supper on olive oil cake with orange and pomegranate sauce - it was immaculate! Provincial old fashioned feel, the unrecorded music after some time just develops the air! PS: Ask for the seat by the window, you may very well get it as we did ! :)"

These are pretty rare, but it's definitely worth spending one on the Pink Door's elevated patio. In fact, make an evening of it by putting on that swooshy little dress you paid too much for and a spritz of expensive perfume. I love their wild mushroom risotto and they make a damn good caesar too. Of course you will enjoy a glass of wine or other pretty drink, and your companion will find you enchanting."

Good show in great ambience, the space is awesome and unique. The food was good but nothing special compared to the hundreds of other Italian places in town. Since it's been over a month ago, I can't even remember what we ordered, which means while it was good it also isn't especially rememberable. Still, you should go check out this historic Seattle restaurant. You won't be disappointed and is you go on a show night all the better."

The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=160,Shay L.,4,11/01/2017,7,WA,One of most vintage and collectively put together restaurants I have been to in Seattle. The simple but elegant aesthetic adds a nice touch to the vibe and provided my time there with relaxing energy. I indulged in the spaghetti with meatballs and enjoyed the simplicity in the flavors.Everything blended well and gave my palled a sweet but organic dance. The pricing is far and if you have dessert you're only coming out of your pocket about 40$. HIGHLY recommended!!!!

I came here and had the grilled Caesar salad and it's hands down the most delicious plate I've ever had. It was so good I couldn't even wait to take a picture.

I eagerly asked our waitress for more bread so I can lap it all up. My girlfriend ordered the risotto which was so craftily made and had such exquisite flavor and wasn't overcooked nor undercooked but just right. For dessert we got the apricot and strawberry crumble which was too sweet, but thank god we had some ice cream to tone it down."

I 'd been here once before, and had an excellent experience, so I convinced the group to check it out. As before, there was an accordion group, which totally rocked (we lucked out and got a table close to the stage). I went with the chilly dungeness crab dish, and between the four of us, we killed two bottles of wine, and totally enjoyed ourselves. Everyone adored their plates too, and the desserts were divine. Highly recommended."

Undoubtedly one of these areas which makes you feel as if you have finally found the city and broken out of the tourist routine, regardless of the closeness to Pike's Place I could not decide between 4 and 5 stars, but it gets five to counter all the whinging."

Decent views of the water and downtown.They have some vegan options here, which was a nice surprise (I am not Vegas but when going with friends). I am a big fan of the puttanesca.I have only seen the ""show"" once, and it was entertaining but the real star is the food.Its called the Pink door because, other than the pink door, you wouldn't know how to find the joint.The bar across the alley was a great place to go after to continue the celebrations. I am drawing a blank on the name."

Plus knowing it was more of a pub it sort of threw the feel off. All the art on the walls and building was a please surprise and was excited about the whole place.The lasagna was fantastic and given the reviews from everyone else it's no suprise as well. Lasagna with some tabasco sauce makes it even better. Especailly with some heat makes the pallet just open up to bring the favor in that much more.

It was my birthday and my friends wanted something different than the usual so we tried it. Overall the food was good, all of our different wines were wonderful and we liked the atmosphere. We went on a Saturday evening so were able to watch the trapeze act. I'm told that they have 3 different trapeze acts a night but we only saw the first one. A little disappointing but still a unique experience. On Sundays they have a Vaudeville type of show that we haven't seen and may go back for that sometime. One note to others who have not been....there is no sign to indicate where the restaurant is outside. You enter from Post Alley and you must look for a kinda pink door to enter the Pink Door. Guess we should have read the yelp reviews before going :)"

The entertainment can be fun. Their appetizers tend to be on the spot. They have nice hours (good for people who work late and whatnot).Pink Door has been a consistently good spot. The particular highlights have been the pasta and the appetizers. Their pappardelle ragu is great! Most often Pink Door has been delivered via Postmates. It's one of the most solid bets for Italian we've found for delivery."

I never thought a simple looking dish could taste that incredible. It's a must-order. The calamari was excellent as well. We assumed it was the usual deep fried dish but it wasn't. It was a nicely sauteed dish with garlic, tomatoes, spinach and white wine. When you enter through the pink door, you'll be mesmerized by how pretty the place is. It's an ambiance I'd imagine my reception to have if I had a small wedding party. The setting was whimsical, elegant and romantic.The back part of the restaurant has a more laid-back feel and is also where the bar is located! There's also an outdoor seating area - perfect to enjoy a meal with your S/O or friends."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=190,Aj G.,4,7/24/2015,6,CA,"You Gotta Go Once... this is one of those places that is the complete experience. Right from the start, the whole idea that there is no sign, just a pink door on an alley, gets you in the theme. It's not that hard to find if you pay attention, and look over the wall and see all the people dining on the deck that hangs over the water with an amazing view. Once inside, it's got that old Seattle brothel décor, and if you time it right, a trapeze artist twirling around for her 5 minute performance every 30 minutes. If you book online, it's for seating outside. We were there during a rare heatwave, so outside at night was great. Perfect view of the water, the Great Wheel, and a cool statue on the neighbor's balcony next door.The service was good, friendly, attentive, informative. The food was tasty, but my two teenaged sons reported it was not enough food. They both ordered the Pappardelle, which was only that on a plate. I ordered a really juicy piece of freshly caught king salmon, and my husband ordered cioppino. My plate was the tastiest, simple and fresh. The cioppino was good, but neither a brothy soup or a plated dinner, it was somewhere in between.If you somehow book a table inside, it's more crowded, intimate, and entertaining for sure. On Saturdays they have a cabaret show, which is separate from the meal."

Their Cesar sounds so simple but its so good either add the shrimp or the crab. We tried the fish of the day and cioppino. Let me just say Seattle gets down with their see food. This place is always busy and they have live music almost everyday of the week. The entrance in an alley way so its fun to find. Close to Pike Market and Downtown. Very Romantic and from now on will make it a point to dine here every time I come to Seattle."

The menu could of have a few more options, however all the food was good quality. I will for sure take my wife back in the summer for the out door seating our waiter mentioned to us.

Everything was great. But I got the lasagna which was delicious but small and I was still hungry after. The rigatoni with mamas meatballs was delicious but more on the Al dente side than we wanted. The meatball I thought it was just ok. But it's a popular dish. And the rose hips to my lips was really sweet but tasty.

Pink Door impresses with its thoughtfully crafted dishes and inviting atmosphere. The Ahi Tuna Crudo was fresh and bright and was complemented by fried capers and microgreens, creating a balanced plate with delightful textures and flavors. The Lasagna Pink Door, rich with spinach and perfectly melted cheese, exceeded my expectations despite not being a huge lasagna fan. The Lemon Risotto with Prawns had a bright, lemony taste that wasn't overpowering. The creamy risotto was decadent yet light, while the prawns were large, flavorful, and juicy. For dessert, the Tiramisu was creamy with soft, spongey ladyfingers and a pleasant coffee taste. The Espresso Martini, though smooth and potent, left me wishing for a creamier texture, but that's personal preference. Reservations can be hard to come by, but walk-ups are an option if you're willing to wait. The beautifully decorated interior and attentive, friendly service make Pink Door a charming spot worth the effort to visit."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=250,Eli T.,5,08/01/2024,152,CA,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Pink Door in Seattle, and it was an exceptional experience. Our waitress, Krista, did an excellent job recommending meals, appetizers, and drinks. She was attentive, ensuring our waters were always filled, which added to the overall positive experience.The ambiance was wonderfully relaxing, enhanced by a beautiful view of The Sound and West Seattle. The setting alone makes this place worth visiting.Now, onto the food. The lemon risotto is a must-try; it's perfectly balanced and flavorful. The crab and corn salad appetizer is another standout, bringing the freshness of Northwest crab right to your table. However, the oil served with the bread could be improved; it's a bit lacking for dipping six pieces of bread. A little more oil would go a long way.Despite this minor detail, Pink Door is a must-go destination. Just be sure to look for the huge line, as the entrance can be easy to miss.---"

The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=360,Phuong X.,5,04/04/2023,4,WA,"The ambiance here is the BEST! An old speakeasy (or so the story goes) turned restaurant. It's in an alley and there's no sign, just literally a pink door. You walk in and you're at the top of a staircase overlooking the restaurant. There's often live music and one time I saw an aerial artist performing during our dinner. The food is mostly Italian fare. I usually get a fish dish like Ahi tuna or halibut and a Caesar or kale salad. Having lived in Japan, I'm very picky about my fish, and the fish I've had here has always been fresh. Tables in the back have a great view of the water. On sunny summer days you can eat on the patio. I recommend for a romantic dinner, a business lunch or a gathering of adult friends or family."

We ordered two dishes, the Squid Ink Tonnarelli and the Lasagna Pink Door, and both were outstanding. The Squid Ink Tonnarelli was perfectly cooked and had a deliciously unique flavor. The pasta was infused with squid ink, which gave it a slightly briny taste that complemented the breadcrumbs in the dish. The Lasagna Pink Door was equally impressive. It was layered with rich, Bolognese sauce and creamy, making every bite melt in my mouth. We also ordered the Brussels sprouts side dish, which was a standout in its own right. The sprouts were roasted to perfection with a slightly crispy exterior, and the addition of bacon and balsamic vinegar added a wonderful depth of flavor. It was the perfect side dish to accompany our mains. To accompany our meal, we ordered the It Feels Right cocktail and The Pink Door mocktail, both of which were delicious and complemented our dishes perfectly. The It Feels Right cocktail was a refreshing blend of spirits and fruit juices, while The Pink Door mocktail was light and refreshing, making them the perfect complement to our rich and flavorful dishes.The atmosphere of the restaurant was charming and cozy, with the decor adding to the ambiance. Service was impeccable too - our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Overall, I highly recommend The Pink Door for a special dining experience. The food is exceptional, and the atmosphere is perfect for a romantic date or a night out with friends."

Everything we ordered was spot on. Here's a few we especially loved:1. Pink Door Caesar- this had fresh Dungeness Crab and their dressing was slightly different from the usual which we really loved! 2. Pink Door Lasagna- definitely not your typical lasagna - this one is vegan. The pasta layers are thinner than usual, probably using homemade pasta and we're living for those thin layers!! The flavors on here were also bomb. I just wished the pasta was a bit more al dente or firm but still, really good.3. Ahi Crudo- you really can't go wrong with fresh tuna!! We ended up dipping our bread in the sauce afterwards too cause it was so refreshing. Wish it came in a bigger serving for the price paid, but still good.4. White Chocolate Pound Cake Panini- it looks like a savory dish, but this actually makes use of pound cake as the slices with marshmallow and some crunchy things in between. This was my first time seeing dessert made this way, and I loved it. It was quite sweet though, so get this to share! 5. Squid Ink Tonnarelli- generous serving of pasta and shrimp! The pasta was perfectly al dente and the flavors were spot on.SERVICE: their servers were not very welcoming - they never smiled, never made small talk but they were very much efficient. Our glasses of water were never empty."

We were seated immediately in the back room and decided on a bottle of The Dissident from the Mark Ryan Winery (priced at $65). It was delicious and an amazing red blend. Worth it - plus it was date night, so why not! We split the Caesar salad with fennel dusted croutons and it tasted amazing. We also got Mama's Meatballs which were delicious and was accompanied by a super flavorful marinara. For our main courses we both decided on their two specials. The NW Fish of the Day was a pan-seared halibut with black lentils, roasted carrots, and an arugula and shaved fennel salad. \The other special was squid ink pasta cioppino style with a spicy marina. IT WAS FANTASTIC. The noodles tasted fresh and soaked in all of the well-developed spicy sauce and the seafood was cooked perfectly. It was a bit pricey with the bottle of the wine and two appetizers, but it was well worth it and I will definitely be back again. Highly recommend it!"

The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-pink-door-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=680,Ian B.,5,8/25/2016,3,NY,What a great place for some food and atmosphere. It's a bit dark in there with the minimal lighting so it really feels like you're alone with you're party or significant other. My girlfriend brought me here the other day and we had a wonderful time enjoying the rosiotto pasta. There is entertainment as well which we didn't really expect even though she knew more about it than me. Our waiter was very helpful and knowledgable when picking wines for our dessert (which was also to die for). In conclusion I would highly recommend going here on a thursday night to get the full experience.

Its our wedding anniversary. I checked out a bunch of restaurants ahead of time and decided on The Pink Door due to it's combination of romantic decor, reasonable price and great food reviews.I was mildly worried about some of the comments regarding rude servers and such but figured it was still the best bet in town.After a long day running all over the Pike Place market, we arrived for dinner at 6:30. We were promptly seated and for the life of me can't remember our waiters name. He was extremely polite and had the specials down pat. I ended up ordering the spinach lasagna while my husband had the spaghetti and meatballs. Our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and we began to enjoy our meal.After just a few bites, a busser working near our table dropped a water glass which shattered all over the floor. As far as we could tell, none of it hit us or the table next to us so we continued our meal. Almost immediately another female employee came up and asked us if we were ok and if any glass had gotten in our food. We told her that it didn't but she insisted on having the food remade just in case. We told her we understood and she removed the old food. Our waiter showed up at the same time and was also concerned about our welfare.A short while later our new food arrived and everything was great. When we went to pay, our waiter brought the check and explained that both our entrees were on the house due to the accident. I told him that wasn't necessary but was greatly appreciated.I just wanted to say a special thanks to all the employees who helped us for making a memorable anniversary. We will definitely be back to The Pink Door on our next anniversary..."

I discovered it four years ago when looking for a good Italian place near work (I was at Macy's at the time) and found this place on yelp. I called ahead and they weren't busy so I thought I would stop by. Boy was I impressed. To this day, not even a home cooked lasagna by mom could satisfy my craving for what they make. Since that day I have taken friends who all have loved the food and service, and have come alone. I find the patio to be a wonderful place to enjoy a nice glass of wine and a good book. I also promised myself that night that someday I would have a boyfriend who would take me there on a date. We've been together for two years now, have a five month old daughter, and are now engaged.

All in all, this was the top seller among the many Biang Biang-style noodle joints across the country.(original)The service was quick and good, but the food left much to be desired. The dry mix mala noodle turns out to be lukewarm water, and it is called ""mala"" and spoken. The popcorn chicken was served with martyr's heads...

While the wait time after ordering was a bit lengthy, clocking in at 25 minutes for a bowl of noodles, the taste was okay, though not particularly surprising. Unfortunately, the Popcorn Chicken didn't live up to expectations; it's definitely not recommended as it didn't taste like it was supposed to.To add to the disappointments, my Mike tea never arrived, but the server promptly addressed it by removing it from the bill. Getting water refilled proved challenging, possibly due to a busy time and a shortage of servers during the shift. Despite these drawbacks, the server's attentiveness in handling issues and the acceptable noodle taste make me consider giving Biang Biang Noodle another chance, hoping for improvements. Three stars for now."

The service was impressively fast - my order arrived almost as soon as I sat down, which was great! The pork options, especially in the noodles, were really flavorful and tender, adding a nice savory depth to the dish.The soup, though, could have used a bit more kick. I was hoping for a little more spice to balance the richness of the broth. And while the noodles were delicious and freshly made, the prices felt a bit on the higher side for a casual spot. Still, Biang Biang left me satisfied, and I'd happily return for another round - maybe next time I'll ask for extra spice!"

They are delightfully chewy, clearly hand-pulled, and fresh. The mala flavor is executed perfectly, making these dishes truly outstanding. While I would pass on the dumplings, I personally lean towards the soup dishes over the dry ones, as the latter can sometimes be a bit too dry. Nonetheless, it's quite a challenge to find a noodle place with a better texture than this."

Honestly the price point wasn't my favorite part of trying this lil bao, but in all honesty, I'd come back to try the noodles rather than the bao. I think it would be more worth it, after seeing my friends eating their noodle dishes while I was eating a bao...

The place was bustling, with only two servers handling the crowd. I had to wait between 5 to 10 minutes before being seated. Having done my research, I promptly ordered the Mala Spicy Beef Dry Mix, a popular choice among Yelpers. Biang Biang specializes in hand-pulled noodles, known as lamian in Chinese. These noodles are made by repeatedly stretching and folding a piece of soft wheat dough to align the gluten and warm it up. The dough is then rolled out to a workable thickness and cut into portions.The food arrived quickly. Despite being called ""dry,"" the dish wasn't completely dry like Hakka noodles, which is something to keep in mind if you're new to the restaurant. Unlike some Chinese/Vietnamese dishes that might include broth with animal bone marrow or blood, this dry order didn't contain any such elements.The Mala Spicy Beef Dry Mix was delicious and perfectly spiced (I ordered medium spicy). The portion was generous. Despite needing to ask for a fork (I know, sacrilege), I wasted no time digging in.The table service was adequate but not proactive. I had to flag down my server once for the fork and later for a glass of water, both of which were brought promptly.Finding parking in the area can be difficult and expensive. It cost me $6 for an hour of street parking several blocks away from the restaurant.The seating area is not huge, but the tables more closely spaced than in a traditional American restaurant. There appeared to be a flight of stairs leading to an upper level, but I didn't see anyone using it.The prices are competitive, reflecting Seattle's pricey food scene. Overall, I'd not hesitate to return."

Tucked away on 12th Avenue, this gem offers a unique experience, starting with the mesmerizing spectacle of watching their chefs hand-pull the namesake noodles. These wide, chewy ribbons are the foundation for a symphony of deliciousness.My personal favorite is the Spicy Dry Beef Noodles. The perfectly cooked beef melds with the chili oil-infused sauce, creating a dance of heat and savoriness.

I believe they're known for their dry mix noodles, but my favorite has to be the pork rib soup noodles. The spice level is perfect too, I normally go for medium and it's a great balance. Service is prompt, food comes out super fast. The restaurant is also casual, a perfect spot for a chill dinner. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait during busy times, but the line goes by decently fast. Overall a great spot for a cheap dinner in cap hill!"

No joke the best place we've eaten at in years. Food was incredible and not over priced - service was fantastic they even boxed our left overs. Not to mention the food was at our table minutes after we ordered, hot n fresh. You must try the the signature six piece wings, popcorn chicken and signature pork noodle soup (sorry I forgot the exact names). My son really liked checking out the fish tank too.

I know I was lucky with the street parking and was seated right away. The service was attentive and helpful. The noodles were good and satisfying - long and chewy. I picked the curry dry and loved the flavor. Three of us ordered our own bowls which was a massive amount of food. Next time, I think we will share. We tried the green onion pancake and popcorn chicken. The highlights were the noodle dishes so I'll just stick with those. Especially the tofu or veggie bowl.I really enjoyed my visit and already looking forward to going back. :)"

I wasn't sure what to order and what the different noodle styles meant. The customer service was great as the cashier explained the different option and the style of the restaurant. It looks really nice. I ordered the cumin lamb dry mix and a crispy chicken bao. My order was done in the time frame I had been given, about 15 minutes. I also really liked how there were chairs outside the restaurant for me to sit and wait since not many places have that right now. The lamb lamb was well portioned and was very flavorful. The crispy chicken boa was delicious. I really enjoyed my experience and will be trying something new off their menu next time I'm in Cap Hill."

We had pushed the food out of our sons reach and were probably taking up one extra seating. Plain simple rude to ask a customer to change seats while in the middle of a meal, completely ruined my appetite and my $70 down the drain!! Addressed issue with manager only to be told that a lie, that the party had a reservation. Never going back again!"

I came here one night and knew I had to get the spicy jumbo wings, they good, but just drenched in fish sauce and it was just so heavily breaded that it wasn't much meat underneath. Now don't get me wrong, I can handle my fish suave being that I'm Vietnamese, but this was just too much for me. We also got the shrimp paste grilled on lemongrass stalks and that too was just way too over powering and made it almost too bitter to eat. Over all the decorations were fun and interesting to look at. The cocktails were mediocre. And the wait is always so long, there are better Thai restaurants in the area with no wait and food you can actually enjoy."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Edwiny D.,3,05/04/2021,5,WA,Ok the taste was pretty good but the food seemed to be not that fresh. Considering the allure of the restaurant I believe these things matter a lot. The food seems to be a bit uncooked and that made me notice the staleness of the food upon observation. I'll give it a 3/5.

Totally loved it.But why 3 starts?Ordered -Cambodian Salor Kari Sap Curry : isn't exciting as it sounds. This is a Thai food. I could get this at a thai place for much cheaper price. Tastes great though.Price on this item was $20. Yes, you get less than half the portion you expect. Totally overpriced.

Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Patricia A.,4,6/25/2023,44,TX,"Nue offers incredibly flavorful food that will leave your taste buds satisfied. However, one major challenge is finding parking in the area. With only parallel parking spots available, and very few at that, it can be a frustrating experience. Another aspect to note is the communal dining setup, where you may find yourself sharing a table with multiple parties, leaving little elbow room. This can make it difficult to fully enjoy the delicious food without being cautious of bumping into other patrons or accidentally knocking something over. That being said, the fried chicken wings are a standout item on the menu, with a delightful fish sauce that adds an extra layer of flavor. On the other hand, the Vietnamese iced coffee may be a bit too sweet for some tastes. While the portions at Nue are satisfying, it's worth mentioning that the menu prices are on the higher side for the area and ambiance. Lastly, the staff's service is decent, but nothing particularly noteworthy."

Highly recommend the chicken wings and South African Bunny Chow!Went back again last week.Tried their ribs which were fantastic along with the usual suspects but finished the meal with their coconut cake which was marvelous. Love this place !

It's our first time here, and we're confused about what to order. There's a lot to choose from on the menu! The area was clean and packed with people around 7 pm, and we waited for a while to be seated.Their menu consists of food from other countries. The ambiance was unique, and the wall decorations were beautiful and trendy! It catches your attention, and they also have good drinks selections!We will be back soon! Thank you!"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,sasha w.,4,6/13/2021,3,WA,Our order arrived 5 minutes before quoted time in less than an hour of order placed. So convenient and will definitely use again. Good job. Will be calling again real soon. However consider creating a website or an app that will make contacting you guys much more convenient as compared to calling in order to place an order. An app will go in getting more customers for the premises since the app will be available on several platforms and hence easy for the people to download it. Similarly a website will help to advertise the business as well as the services that are offered as well as any other information that might be considered relevant to the customer.

It's a decent spot to sit outside on a pleasant day or inside on a stormy one, attempting one of the yummy mixed drinks from the menu. The proposal is the Sunny Bunny for early lunch or the Bunny Chow for supper."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Maryam O.,4,3/25/2019,5,WA,This place was so fetch. Really great spot for getting a quick bite before heading to bars and I'm kicking myself for not having enough time to get a full meal.

Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=30,Taylor B.,5,1/31/2024,15,WA,"Our initial experience at NUE was fantastic. The diverse menu offered a culinary journey through various flavors. I couldn't help but smile when I spotted Tocilog on their menu, and naturally, I had to order it.The Filipino Tocilog was accompanied by a delightful dipping sauce. The tocino slices were tender, and the egg was perfectly fried to a crisp. The Israeli Shakshuka was expertly cooked and seasoned. Lastly, the Tower of Chengdu Wings provided a satisfying crunch and a hint of spice. The distinct flavors of fish sauce, lime, and peppercorn were unmistakable. The presentation was impressive. All of this was complemented by a glass of ""Less Mosa.""The ambiance of the place is cozy and eclectic, and the service was outstanding. Without a doubt, NUE is a restaurant I'd consider for brunch or dinner when in Capitol Hill."

Von's 1000 Spirits is an American restaurant with an all scratch kitchen specializing in Seattle Sourdough & the largest collection of fine spirits in the cityWe each ordered a burger and were highly impressed. The bun was soft and fluffy, patties homemade, and reminded me of mom & pop shop burgers I would eat as a kid in Pasadena (Lucky Burgers, anyone?) The waiters were all extremely nice and the place was packed! However the vibe still felt intimate. Here are the two types of sandwiches we orderedDouble Smashed American Burger - two prime beef patties, American cheese, caramelized onions, packed dills, lettuce, and some magical sauce"

It's my go to answer whenever anyone asks me where I want to eat. It's also a great date spot. ;)The flavors here are incredible. I can't get enough of the hummus, kale & carrot salad, fresh potato frites, and roti. I generally don't like brussels sprouts but they're my favorite item on Nue's menu. I usually ask them to bring out the pineapple cornbread near the end since it's best when warm, and all their desserts are delicious too."

Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=50,Kelly G.,5,8/14/2019,7,WA,Awesome food in an environment that transports you to another continent. Delicious and creative without being weird or over self indulgent.
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=50,Heather D.,5,8/14/2019,2,WA,"Inventive food. Warm, community-creating environment. Honest, work-their-a**es-off owners and staff. One of my favorite Nue memories has been joining their One-World dinner featuring Syria. Not only were we exposed to delicious food (which, of course, we'd never tried before), but we dined with several Syrians, many of whom were recent refugees. It felt more like someone's home than a restaurant. Thanks, Nue, for enabling me to break (damn good) bread with people I never would have otherwise had the chance to meet."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=50,Phi N.,5,8/14/2019,2,GA,"Nue is hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle.

Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Elizabeth S.,5,8/14/2019,3,WA,"Nue is a unique restaurant in Seattle, and it's worth a trip to Capitol Hill from the 'burbs if you haven't already tried it. It's a small, locally-owned business and the owners travel the world to find new and delicious international street food dishes for their menu, so there's often something new to discover. I'm not an adventurous eater but my husband is, and there's always something there for both of us.The dining room is an intimate setting with decor sourced from all over. Great date-night place in a classy, relaxed setting with international flair. It's also been fun to see it featured on several food TV shows!"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Jannavie C.,5,8/14/2019,8,WA,This place has such a great variety of food from all cultures! I recommend doing family style so that you can try a bunch of different things because everything is delicious! Don't forget to get the tower of wings!!!
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Naveen J.,5,06/09/2019,6,IN,One of the few restaurants where you will not be disappointed when you are adventurous
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,K L.,5,5/24/2019,15,WA,"Even though one of the things I tasted was a giant bug, this is one of the best places to eat in Seattle! It's like taking a round-the-world tour with someone who's crazy about food. The laphet toke and the Chengdu wings remain favorites of ours. The UN skewers were awesome, especially accompanied by the pineapple cornbread. Their house made ice creams are mind blowing too. The water bugs...well, there was a crazy story that goes along with them, that we were lucky enough to hear firsthand from Chris."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Dave B.,5,5/13/2019,1,WA,"I've dined now at Nue twice, and was floored by everything I tried. Having been to many of the countries represented on the menu, I was ready to be disappointed but was impressed by the combination of authenticity and creative spin placed on the food. While I agree it helps to be adventurous (part of the fun eating here), the food is surprisingly accessible. Somewhat randomly, I ended up on a rafting trip on a 4 day rafting trip with Chris Cvetkovich, who owns Nue along with his wife Uyen. We somehow conned Chris to cook for us the entire trip - it was incredible to see him come up with exquisite meals riverside, often improvising with random ingredients from various coolers. More impressive was hearing Chris talk passionately about the people, places, and food he has encountered across the world. Inspiring. I'll be heading back to Nue for the food, but will enjoy it in a new light after spending time with Chris"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Jason W.,5,05/09/2019,7,WA,"I don't eat a lot of meat but when I have a fried chicken craving this is the spot for the best wings I have ever had. The presentation on the wings is awe-striking as you are served a massive tower of perfectly golden brown wings. The wings have the perfect amount of flavor and a mouth watering crunch when you bite into them. If you're looking for a lighter accompaniment to your wings, the Brussel sprouts with coconut are delightful. The negative to the restaurant is it is smaller so it can feel cramped. I wish the tables were a little more spread out and there was better sound dampening. That said it's in Seattle, and I'm sure they've done they best they can in order to make a profit. I highly recommend this place as the top spot for wings in the state. Not only that but they also have a really unique menu with other delicious items."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Jasdip S.,5,4/28/2019,2,WA,Went for brunch and was blown away. Was absolutely delicious. Will come back again and again.

The whole vibe is just incredible. It's community seating and that was very different for us but we enjoyed it so much. Thanks for a bomb meal !"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Bill M.,5,11/04/2018,14,WA,"I was skeptical because I thought the menu looked like a mess. Nothing seemed connected to me, everything felt like it had a million ingredients. But the food was absolutely delicious. We had the mofongo, Brussels sprouts, and the Syrian kale salad, and pineapple cornbread, and all four were phenomenal. The seating is mostly communal and it's tiny and loud so don't expect ambiance. Other than that, it's fab!"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=60,Carolyn W.,5,6/30/2018,13,CA,"Love this place, go hungry be sure to get the chicken wings!"

It is highly unlikely that you have eaten anything that is on the menu. Come willing to try new things. We suggest ordering multiple items and sharing them family style."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Abakum M.,5,5/26/2018,3,CA,"My wife and I came to Nue for dinner on Monday night and had our minds blown. The food was so good! We were dying at each bite, gobbling things up, and so happily full afterwards. Our waiter was so attentive and kind! He kept our water refilled, gave excellent suggestions, and had this kind, friendly air that made it seem like he genuinely cared about our experience. It is so hard to find that kind of warmth in restaurants these days and we were super impressed. I cannot wait for the next time I go to Nue, so that I can try their lunch menu.I give Nue 5 stars because everything was great. When you walk in you get that small business family owned feeling and you just know they do their best to give you a great time."

Found this on Yelp and it became our official breakfast diner! Went three morning in a row and enjoyed each on of them. The servings are large, the price reasonable and the service efficient. This is not gourmet fare but filling and quick. Line ups each morning but never waited more than 10 minutes. The servers were pleasant and responsive to requests and often constantly moving. Everything we ate was good!"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Gift H.,5,07/05/2017,13,WA,So good! The goat curry was so good. Must order McNguyen drink so so yummy! Will be back!

They are gracious and professional. I have the Cuban sandwich which was outstanding. The Mofongo was underwhelming. The communal dining was unexpected but kitschy. I plan to go back.

Not an extensive menu, but a very diverse one that emulates international street food. I really enjoyed the Bunny Chow and Jamaican Jerk Chicken, along with the pineapple cornbread. Relatively young crowd gives the place a lively vibe that reflects many Capitol Hill restaurants."
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,LanaMarie H.,5,2/28/2016,50,WA,Super super good. The pay for parking is totally worth this small menu. The people are A+ nice and friendly
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=70,Rebecca R.,5,12/13/2015,6,CA,The jerk chicken is to die for. We also split the bunny chow and octopus skewers--both were full of flavors. We went on a Tues night and was able to get seated right away.

Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=80,Dave W.,5,8/14/2015,5,WA,"I'm not exactly what you'd call a ""Professional Yelper"" (this is my first review) but this was seriously the BEST meal I've had in years!I started with the Syrian Kale Salad and Tostilocos. The salad was dressed perfectly and the crunch of the toasted almonds and sweetness of the 'shattered dates' (I still need to figure out how they cut them so damn small) were the perfect textural and flavor counterbalance to the dressing.The Tostilocos were really cool and from what I was told, a pretty common Street Food in Mexico. They consisted of a bag of Mexican, Salsa Verde Tostitos, slit open and stuffed with all kinds of flavors and textures that just worked. Hot sauce, crunchy jicama and cucumber, Tamarind candy, nuts, pickled pork skins, etc. Super fun.I then, based on everyone's suggestions on Yelp, had the goat curry. This dish was over the top, or is it 'off the hook'? I can never keep up with these things. Anyway, super complex dish, just the perfect amount of spicy heat and the sweetness of the coconut cornbread on the side was the bomb (or is it the 'shit'?) I had the McNguyen cocktail which was Vietnamese coffee and Irish Jameson Whiskey shaken over ice. This was one of those drinks that could get a pass just for the clever name but OMG the flavor combo was amazeballs. I'd never tried Vietnamese coffee before, and now need to without whiskey, just to taste the pure flavor of it. After that I need to move back to the one with Jameson though because the combo was fantastic.......and I love whiskeyI was totally full by now but wanted to try their liquid nitrogen ice cream I'd heard about and ordered the French Toast and Bacon Flavor. Without going into too much detail let's just say I'm stopping by after work tomorrow just for another scoop.The service was fantastic and the decor super unique and kitschy but didn't feel contrived. I've been to a lot of bars and restaurants that just hang a couple of taxidermy pieces on the wall wearing hats and call it cool but this place definitely has its own character but still feels real (esp for Capitol Hill)I got a chance to chat a lot with one of the owners (he was my waiter) who mentioned that a lot of stuff on the menu changes all the time. Can't wait to come back and see what's new!!"
Nue,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/nue-seattle?not_recommended_start=80,Fran C.,5,08/09/2015,1,WA,"The rating says as good as it gets and indeed our dining experience at Nue was just that. There were four of us that shared this wonderful food, starting off with unusual and very refreshing non-alcoholic drinks. Than we got down to the real event - beautiful food tastes from around the worlds starting off with what became one of my favorites, a yellow pea salad (Theng Manga Pattani Sundal) -nutty crunchy yellow peas served on grilled romaine and finished with lemon oil. Yum! We then slowly shared and array of dishes from the Grilled Barbados Pig tails that had crispy skin and tender juicy meat with a yummy dipping sauce, Jamacian Jerk Chicken that was tender, juicy and just exploding with flavor to the very satisfying sandwich-The Maracas Shark and Bake.  We ate slow and enjoyed each bite as it arrived one at a time. Great service and good tastes. that's as good as it gets."

I like the small plates -- gave me a chance to sample many flavors & dishes -- sort of like an international version of tapas! The dirty diplomat cocktail was also really awesome.

Sexy atmosphere; candles everywhere. Good looking staff to compliment the interior design, but are they super unprofessional!! They were all ripping shots at the bar, including the manager! My waitress was beyond inebriated and slammed everything down that she gave us. Food was honestly good, except the mussels were past their prime. Crumbled inside of my mouth, so I had to spit it out. I expressed my opinion to the drunken waitress as she responded ""eew, gross"" and ran away. Manager came over to smooth things over, but he just made excuses instead of apologizing- probably thinking about his next shot choice. To make matters worse the FOH employees:A) all were talking about us- they're drunk so they can't control the volume of their voices, again the manager is ring leader in this conversation- so inappropriate and unprofessional. B) sent us out another mussel dish, but I was scarred from the first one so I turned it away.I guess I insulted the line cook? Table was in prime view of the kitchen so I could see him looking at the plate, running his mouth and then he gives me a nasty look. Word of advice to him: don't serve anything you wouldn't eat yourself and don't be in denial of when you send out shitty plates. Beautiful place, some dishes great and some sub par, but they need to pay attention to their daily operations, look at the management more and get a new service team before this place goes downhill! Sorry, just saying! I manage in casual fine dining and this behavior/treatment towards guests, I simply would not stand for."

I then asked how long it would take for a bowl of soup to come out so I could eat with them. He said it was only a couple minutes... 20 minutes later I was sitting with no food and the rest of my friends were done eating.

And the music was full of tunes that only could be handled with a scotch on the rocks. At 8 in the morning? NOT!Tonight it was two steaks, one so tough that it ruined what was a good flavor. But my wife's medium well steak came with the cow still mooing, and by the time they delivered the overly well done substitute back after we complained, appetite be gone. Evening ruined while she watched the rest of us eat our entries. This place is fine if you're looking for some good looking babes and don't mind the poor service and hit-and-miss food so you can enjoy the eye candy. But the price isn't cheap.

I went for breakfast on a Sunday and I think the food is over priced and with a small portion size, tastes good though.The inside is pretty tacky. It looks like they have sheets stapled to the ceiling to hide the insulation.

The food is consistently tasty, and you can tell that a lot of care and attention is put into the preparation of each dish. The menu is varied, and there are plenty of options to choose from, including some creative twists on classic brunch items.However, one downside is that the coffee leaves much to be desired. If you're a coffee lover, you might be disappointed with the quality of the coffee here. Nevertheless, the quality of the food more than makes up for this minor drawback.Overall, if you're looking for a unique brunch experience that incorporates delicious southern flavors, Toulouse Petit is an excellent choice. The only downside is the wait time, but that's just a testament to how popular and beloved this spot is."

Food quality and taste was kind a all over the place. The Dungeness crab over fried green tomatoes was very good and I'd highly recommend it. Fried half chicken over gravy was also seasoned well and very tasty. The seafood gumbo tasted a little under seasoned, peppery enough, but lacking something. The kurobota pork/gnocchi was the saltiest food I've ever had at a restaurant. It paired well with the gumbo though. The beignets also may not be what people expect. Ours tasted slightly overcooked on the outside but extremely doughy and pasty on the inside. I've heard that's the New Orleans style though. I'd normally give it a lower rating, but it had a very nice vibe and solid service. Presentation was decent, price wasn't too high, and they seemed to be accommodating of groups without reservations. I'd like to try their brunch next time. Overall, the entire covid situation hasn't been particularly great for any restaurant, so it's good to see them still working."

Overall good but Caused a bit of a seen. Bastard door boy asked for my vax card so I hollered at him and floored it and bowled through a bunch of tables. Gotta let these vaxMaxxers im not to be messed with.

To drive a specific review though, I took my partner here for birthday brunch. We were told it would be about 45 minutes and it was, in fact, exactly about 45 minutes. The hostess was friendly and set the right expectations, so kudos there. Once seated, our server greeted us and got us on our way. Everything came out quickly and well prepared and was just delicious. Like, seriously good. Everytime. Only negatives are that the parking sucks (that's seattle for you) and that to get to the bathroom, you need to go through the kitchen which honestly weirds me out, but love love love this place."

Why do I have to pay for my meal, a tip, and subsidize the living wage that the owner of this establishment should be paying. Stop trying to drain your customers for every cent they have.

Food was amazing!!!! First night, service was fantastic. 2nd night, we cancelled our last drink order (that was almost 10 minutes old), paid our bill and left. If you go, hope you get the good staff, and definitely start with the 'fried chicken gumbo'!!!"

I love the shrimp and grits combo and the jambalaya is really good. A tad salty....but good. I have been here twice so far, once for my anniversary. I did find that the cocktails I ordered were a little bitter and sometimes lacked sweetness that you expect from a cocktail. But the overall flavor was delicious. Just add a little more sweet and it would be perfect. We ordered the Pastini risotto and the corn and sweet onion Macque Choux which was absolutely delish. I would order those again. They were plentiful in size as well. So my husband and I split those while waiting for our entrees. We also ordered the braised and fried bacon which was delicate and cooked perfectly. I just wished there was more. The entrees are a little on the small side and we ordered a half chicken and a ribeye. I had to send the ribeye back because it was way overcooked. But they brought us a new one and didn't charge us for either. Which was awesome. The ribeye they brought us was laid on top of a delicious mash with a blue cheese on the steak. It was so good. My half chicken was also good, but a little lacking in size. Had I only ate the entrees, I would have been left very hungry. I suggest you get sides to go with your meal. It's a little on the expensive side, but it is good. Of course there are some imperfections that could use a little tweaking but overall, I love this place. At the end of our anniversary dinner, the waitress brought us some free beignets in a chicory sauce. The sauce itself was so good and so were the beignets if you've never had one. Granted I've had better at another establishment, but the thought was really nice. They have a huge wine list as well. The atmosphere is lovely and I think you should at least try it once."

The place is known for brunch, which is when I went. The place is busy so you may have to wait. The place is crowded a bit noisy. The service is fairly quick, slow enough to talk but not slow. The food is tasty and hot. The other person that I was with had a crab omelet which actually had chunks of crab, not imitation crab or tiny bits. The portion size is average to slightly large.They have no parking so street parking is what you have to find. On Sundays, it's easy. On other days, if you go for brunch, it's probably ok."

I, however, got a great salad and some sides--much to the weird grumbling behavior of my waiter who (every time I asked for something) looked at me like I was from Mars. Hello--high end does great wonders for us vegan/veg--esp when our companions order a butt load from your menu!Everything else was grand--from the setting to the beautiful people eating there. Ok, maybe I am wrong...maybe it wasn't that my waiter was less than stellar because I am veg. We have two theories: 1) (my companions' version) you, pierced waiter, had a crush on me and were jealous that i was two hunky guys or 2) (my version) you, pierced waiter, were jealous that I was coming between you and my two sexxxy male companions would have loved to have eaten you for desert.Go there.

Perfectly poached eggs atop fresh, succulent crab, all smothered in a silky hollandaise sauce. Every bite was a symphony of flavors that transported me straight to New Orleans.Seafood Jambalaya: The seafood jambalaya was spot on. The rice was perfectly cooked, and the medley of seafood--shrimp, crawfish, andouille sausage--was seasoned to perfection. It had just the right amount of spice to leave a lasting impression without overwhelming the palate.The atmosphere at Toulouse Petite is warm and inviting, with a cozy, yet vibrant vibe that makes you feel right at home.

Nestled in a quaint corner, this establishment not only boasts exquisite antique decor but also exudes a warm, inviting ambiance. The staff, with their impeccable service, further elevated my dining experience.Now, let's talk about the star of the show - the Crème Caramel French Toast. This divine creation, adorned with succulent strawberries and luscious pecan butter, is a symphony of flavors. The marriage of crème and caramel is a delight to the senses, but it's the pecan butter that truly steals the show. Its heavenly blend of sweetness and nuttiness leaves you craving for more.As I relish every bite, I must also commend the perfectly crispy strips of bacon that accompany this masterpiece.

However, I recently visited for lunch and was pleasantly surprised with the meal. I enjoyed a Cajun Shrimp Po' Boy with a small salad and side of fries. The Po' Boy was delicious and had a generous amount of shrimp. The salad was well dressed, and the fries were nice and crispy. Although I have been several times it never gets old the New Orleans style atmosphere that breaks up the Seattle Contemporary style that most restaurants fall back on for decoration. The staff was polite and quick to respond before I could ask. All in all, Toulouse should be on your list whether a visitor from out of town or a long-time resident. Thank you for the great lunch and will be dining here again soon. P.S. This is one of, if not the, best brunch spots in Seattle if you like Cajun style foods."

I was skeptical of the legitimacy of a French-Creole restaurant in Seattle, since we unfortunately don't have many restaurants serving that type of cuisine, but I held out hope that this one would prevail, since I love French-Creole food!I made a reservation for 7:30 on a Sunday night, and upon arrival, we were seated immediately. The restaurant was packed to the brim, and the atmosphere was buzzy, but not overly loud. The dining room itself is dark and dimly lit - a perfect ambience for a romantic date. You can tell the painstaking labor put into creating this restaurant, from the thousands of hand-laid tiles to the hundreds of candles the restaurant's staff lights each night (detailed in the back part of the menu, if you want to know more). Service was friendly and helpful, if a bit slow (though I totally understand, since it was a weekend). After getting seated, our waitress asked us if we wanted bread ($7, comes with butter), and it came out a couple minutes later, piping hot and fresh from the oven. It was a pretty authentic French baguette (coming from someone who has had some of Paris's best), though I will say that it is a bit bland, so eat it with the salted butter! The sommelier came out, and my dad ordered an Alsatian red that he was curious about. The somm seemed extremely knowledgeable and was more than happy to talk about the extensive wine list! The wine itself was very fairly priced with minimal markup for a restaurant, and there's really something for everyone on the 16-page list. We ended up ordering four entrees, which we split among the four of us. My entree, the Grimaud Farms Muscovy Duck Confit over Lentils de Puy with Local Butternut Squash ($34), was delicious - the duck was crispy and flavorful, and the lentils were hearty and well-spiced without being heavy. I will say that the portion of my entree was relatively small (the duck leg was small and there wasn't much butternut squash at all), but there was a good amount of lentils. My brother ordered the Big Easy Jambalaya ($33), which comes in a sizzling skillet piled high with prawns, chicken, house-made andouille sausage, and tasso ham. The rice on the bottom was perfectly cooked (not hard, but not mushy at all), and had absorbed the rich, deep Creole flavors of the spice mix and meats on top. It was slightly spicy, but we actually wished it were a little spicier! My mom ordered the Jumbo Wild 'Barbecue Shrimp' New Orleans ($36). The shrimp was well-seasoned, with some sort of Creole seasoning (cayenne pepper and paprika being some standout flavor notes), and they were quite large, as the name suggested. The grits were so rich and creamy (complimented amazingly by the chives/scallions served on top), but we couldn't finish the whole portion for that reason. Finally, my dad ordered the Puget Sound Pacific Mussels with Roasted Shallot-Coriander Paste/Red Basil Nuoc Cham and Pommes Frites and Aioli ($21, $9 extra for frites). This surprised us by being our favorite dish of the night; apart from getting a very generous portion of both mussels and pommes frites, both were perfectly cooked, and we loved the Vietnamese-style sauce that the mussels came in (and we especially loved dipping the baguette in it!). We were so full by the end of the meal that we couldn't even think about getting dessert, but all of the desserts we saw other tables ordering looked amazing, and we would definitely go back to try them another time. Ultimately, I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a romantic date night or a celebratory dinner. No, the prices are by no means cheap, but I think that the portions are fairly generous here, and it's no more expensive than Seattle's other high-end, classy date-night restaurants. The food and ambience couldn't be better, the restaurant itself is beautiful, and the service is great - we'll definitely be going back!"

I ended up googling some stuff myself, just because I rarely eat Creole food. But in the best way, and trying something new. It was cheerful, but cozy, with a velvet banquette of small candles. After ordering custom from the impressive, yet overwhelming, menu, we had prawns, chori and grits."

The restaurant itself was beautiful and atmospheric, and the food was absolutely delicious. They had a wide array of selections for different price ranges, which was appreciated. We had Sea Scallop Coins, the Seafood Gumbo, and an arrangement of 3 of their cheeses. Every dish blew us away, and the service provided by our waiter, Harrison, made this an incredibly memorable experience. He was perceptive, friendly, and good-humored; he even noticed my wife's ring and congratulated us. He even went as far as giving as a plate of beignets as a congratulations--above and beyond service, and I only wish I could have tipped more. After our first night there, we already know we want to come here again as often as we can. I have no complaints about my experience at Toulouse!"

I have been here three times in three weeks and would suggest that everyone go there. I felt wind and dined and like a princess. The bartender went out of his way so much to make me feel special that I actually went home and picked a fight with my husband because I have never had a man wait on me hand and foot the way he did. LOL! When I ran across the street to the store, I came back and found a beautiful glass of wine, dessert, and a complementary to go bag because he wanted me to try a certain dish that I wanted to order but never did.

The potatoes were flavored perfectly and I ate my whole dish! That was probably one of the best brunch's that I have had in a very long time.

Of course they only seat groups when majority of the group is there so we were bumped a few times which was fine because the hostess was so kind and light hearted about it, making us feel welcomed and not an inconvenience.When we were seated our waitress was very friendly and had very cool, tasteful tattoos that I was very well done; hey weren't tackey. The food came all at once so none of us had to wait for each others orders to arrive which was very impressive seeing that it was very busy and most restaurants will generally serve based on what comes out of the kitchen first. All of it was nice and hot and delicious. I had the Oyster and Bacon Benedict which was perfect. The eggs were poached but still had that delicious running yolk. The oysters where breaded and fried but not cooked all the way through giving it a very ocean-y flavor which I thought added an unique flavor to the entire dish. All the staff was friendly and had a smile on which I know from experience is a very hard thing to do on a Saturday morning during a rush. Definitely coming back here again."

I'm inclined to agree. I've been here somewhere between five and ten times for happy hour and we have barely scratched the surface of the happy hour menu! The sides are the best! Everything is less than five bucks! I especially like the corn grits, the haricots verts with bacon (that's green beans) and the Brussels sprouts. We've tried the alligator and found it to be absolutely delicious, and the basics like several varieties of sliders. And let's not forget dessert! White chocolate bread pudding, apple crisp and pear tart. As a fan of biegnets from Cafe du Monde in New Orleans I was afraid to try an obvious impersonator, but Toulouse biegnets are stand-alone outstanding. I love this place!"

Pork cheek hash was out of this world, and my dining partner had the biscuit and gravy- were fantastic, a sexed up version of the diner classic. Oh-- and daytime drinking- (we were celebrating!) drinks were on special too- the Breakfast Milk Punch & Katie Mae were a wonderful addition to the best Thursday afternoon in my recent memory."

This was my first time at Toulouse, a friend had asked me to go with her to an event there. Now I realize they don't normally have live music, but they did last night, and it was GREAT. Even better though was the food. My goodness. The best grits I've had in ten years, BBQ prawns, fried green tomatoes, and an AMAZING halibut dish.   Our service was attentive, fast but not rushed (and thats saying something because this place was packed), and the girl running the front door was right on with her menu suggestions!   I will be going back to Toulouse, and often. If you haven't been, you should go see for yourself."

But I did get a chance to sample almost all of the dishes and the short review: AWESOME. But before I dive into the food, I should mention the decor. The decor is amazing. All the tables were handmade and inlaid with intricate designs. Each table took at least 12 man hours to construct. All the metal work (lights, bottom of tables, partitions in the bathrooms, etc.) were all done and custom built on site. The plaster on the walls was made with many, many layers and then chipped away to reveal all the colors. Amazing. The man hours spent on this restaurant must have been insane. Now food. When I go to a restaurant to do a sampling like this, I usually have a few I like, maybe 1 or two that I love, and a few that are just so-so. Just about everything I had that night was amazingly good. I loved almost every single dish I tried. The dishes all have a New Orleans/Creole/Cajun flair. I had so many dishes that it's hard for me to remember all the goodness. Pork cheek: amazingly tender and terrific seasoning. Alligator: tastes like chicken. Really. And it's great with the mashed potatoes. Gumbo: had two servings. There were lots more, but just can't recall them off my head at the moment. What I do remember most fondly was the bananas fosters. That made me want to weep for happiness. It might have been the booze that I was drinking all night, but that and the other desserts were all amazing. I really can't wait to go back and get full size portions of their food.One other thing that needs to be mentioned is the bar. The bar area occupies the significant majority of the floor space. The liquor porn that's up on that wall is amazing. There's something like 40+ different vodkas (flavors and brands). Again, since I was at a tasting event I didn't see a menu. I left it up to bartender Miles Thomas (who also works at Tavern Law -- another one of my favorites) to pour me some libations. My favorite drink of the night had some gin and champagne in it. I didn't get to see everything that he poured, but I could drink that all night long.I can't wait for Toulouse to officially open. I'll be there often."

The service was slow, and we had to wait nearly an hour for our food to arrive at the table. The extended wait time significantly impacted our overall enjoyment of the evening. The menu was also very limited however the food did taste really good. I hope the restaurant can improve its efficiency to provide a better dining experience for future patrons."

Ended up taking two hours. There were homeless people everywhere outside made for a very uncomfortable wait. Then the host had the AUDACITY to tell us he only had one table that would be for a reservation later so we would have to eat within an hour after our long wait. Horrible service and overpriced for eggs and toast that are masked by an instagrammable presentation.

After ordered it took 10 mins to get them. We didn't get our appetizers until 50 mins after we sat down. Appetizers were the best dishes in the house though. Burrata and vegetable tart were amazing. Main courses came 45 mins later and were mediocre. The halibut was over cooked and the meatballs were over taken by the tomato sauce. Less sauce would have been better. The waitress was loud and would engage a table from 3 tables away.Then they started setting up(moving chairs, tables, and just being a distraction while we had dessert.)Overall experience was ""how is this place booked out so far for decent food and the worst fine dining wait staff""?"

It was about 2 tablespoons of wet sludge.. my friends asked ""is this a joke? "" when it was put in the tale. ..Old fashioned garnish consisted of poorly sliced cantaloupe complete with rhind on one side. Lucky for me it was floating in the egg/salmon liquid so was inedible.

Our server was a delight, the interior exuded comfort, and the food was simply scrumptious. The French onion soup was rich in flavor and featured a delightful cheese crust. I decided to try the savory Dutch baby, and it turned out to be an exceptionally delectable choice. I regret not ordering it for myself. The warm mini baguette and the light, delightful profiteroles with vanilla ice cream rounded off the meal perfectly.

We got the savory Dutch babies and the house quiche. It was my first Dutch babies so I didn't know what to expect. I wish we could've gotten more toppings in it. The house quiche was very good, I liked it a lot more than the Dutch babies because of the crust and it had more flavors. My boyfriend liked the Dutch babies more because it's got a strong egg taste. For me, it was a bit too much flour."

This turned out to be one of the most rewarding decisions we made that day!If you're planning a visit, take it from us - make a reservation. We were fortunate that a table became available due to a no-show, but it's clear that this place is popular for a reason.The standout item here has to be the Dutch babies. Available in classic, sweet, and savory varieties, these delightful treats are the restaurant's pièce de résistance. Note that they take 25-35 minutes to prepare, but they're worth every delicious moment of anticipation.Our choice was the savory option, an irresistible combination of pancetta, asparagus, spring garlic, and provolone. Served fresh from the oven, it was an indulgent medley of gooey, cheesy goodness enveloped by perfect dough. A hint of hot sauce, thoughtfully brought to our table without prompting, added just the right zing.Complementing our meal was the French onion soup - a sinfully decadent rendition, amplified with crouton, Gruyere, and bacon, and a distinct red wine flavor that made it one of the best I've ever tasted.What sets Tilikum Place Cafe apart, beyond its incredible food, is the ambiance and staff. The entire team is friendly and the space is warm and inviting, creating a comforting environment akin to dining at home with loved ones.Tilikum Place Cafe is more than a meal, it's a memorable dining experience that resonates long after you've savored the last bite.

We also had the lamb and feta cheese Dutch pancake! Small cozy place.

Been around Seattle for a while so I feel like I am taking part of keeping 90's Seattle alive by eating here. Service is good even when it gets a bit cramped up in there. At times the brunch wait can be up to an hour-- but more power to them. Glad many like to go there and eat. Not there fault they are popular...can only seat so many folks at once. I have been treated like family and have become a regular. I like the fry up and the dutch baby.

I've eaten dinner twice, and both meals were excellent. Last night, my wife and I shared both a squash tart and an order of calamari stuffed with chorizo with martinis...then a wonderful bowl of parsnip puree soup. Our main courses were a pork chop and a dish of braised rabbit with spinach and mushroom dumplings...but something went wrong. Somehow, the chef thought we wanted the rabbit loin wrapped with pancetta. When the error was discovered in the kitchen, the dish was sent out gratis, and the correct braised rabblt dish was immediately fired. We enjoyed the rabbit loin... and probably would order it again! A very brief wait provided an interlude, then we enjoyed our (correct) entrees.I tell this story because the test of a restaurant is how it addresses problems, and they did a wonderful job of turning a problem into a delightful experience.The Tilikum Cafe is a wonderful, relaxing bistro, and you ought to try them out!"

Watching the chef work his magic was more exciting than some Cirque shows. Hubby had the chicken soup, which had lovely lime undertones. I had the grilled romaine salad with peaches, which was so good, I'm going to try to recreate it at home. Our main courses were the chicken, which understandably is a signature dish. The crusty skin, the herbs/spices, the juiciness of the meat, the mushroom sauce, all worked to create one of the best chicken dishes either of us have ever had. My pasta with hazelnut would have stood out except for how great the chicken was. We shared their signature dessert, profiteroles, served with vanilla ice cream and a caramel sauce flavored with my fav, cardamom. Hubs & I wish a restaurant like this would open in Las Vegas."

I've got unreasonably high standards, and having been repeatedly disappointed by previous gambles on new places, I now prefer to wait until the reviews come in so I can have at least some assurance that I won't be wasting my money and calories. So my husband really had to twist my arm to get me to go to Tilikum Place Cafe for brunch this morning and, to be honest, the only reason I agreed to go is that I was starving and it's just one block away from our condo. ""Be brave!"" he said. ""Uh-uh."" ""Cluck cluck cluck!"" ""Uh-uh."" ""It's right down the alley, you'll be eating in minutes!"" Done!Well chalk one up for hubby. I was encouraged right away when I got what was possibly the best cappuccino of my life, served with a lump of raw sugar and a tiny little shortbread cookie. I felt even more optimistic when we split a tender, house-made orange cream scone. Then I knew everything was going to be okay when we got our main courses. I had a savory Dutch baby with delicata squash and goat cheese, served in the mini-cast iron skillet it was baked in, along with a pitcher of warm maple syrup, and my husband had baked eggs with spinach and bread crumbs. I'm not sure which was better. The eggs were tender and creamy and had those golden crunchy bread crumbs, but the Dutch baby was so light and right on the fence between savory and sweet. We also had a nice little baguette with butter and jam. If you're a quarterback, you're going to want to order more than we did, but for us it was the perfect amount of food, and incredibly our bill (for two people! in Belltown!) came to only $31. Our waitress was charming and attentive, and explained that the owner is also the chef, almost always a good thing in my experience. The food was easily as good as that at, say, Dahlia Lounge or Lola. I can't wait to go back for dinner. I think we're going to wear a groove in the alley between our condo and this place!"

The local manager was fine but the senior management had an uncaring attitude could not be flexible to my situation. I found this to be very unfortunate and the worst form of customer relation. My case did not require anything out of ordinary since it only required the chefs to make a customized meal for me. The facts here were that I could either be asked to pay an extra cost or be advised on the other best alternatives. I tried to suggest this to the management and this is where I realized that the middle level management was accommodative of my suggestions, however they could not be able to make a decision without the top management.

List,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/list-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Luke L.,4,2/22/2023,192,WA,"The food at List was definitely the highlight of our experience. The menu had a nice variety of dishes to choose from and everything we ordered was well prepared and delicious. However, the reason we went to List was for happy hour and unfortunately, the ambiance wasn't quite suited for it. The lighting was quite dim and the space felt a bit cramped, especially since we were a large group of 13 people. Not the convivial milieu we were expecting.Despite this, the servers were fantastic and really did their best to make us feel comfortable. They were very accommodating and attentive to our needs, even going so far as to gift us a complimentary bottle of wine. We appreciated their efforts and thought it was a really nice touch.Overall, I would recommend List to anyone who enjoys good food in a cozy atmosphere. However, I would caution against bringing a large group for happy hour as the space might be a bit cramped. That said, I would definitely come back to List if I was in the area, but perhaps with just one or two other people."
List,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/list-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Christian J.,4,2/17/2023,9,FL,"Upon arriving at ""List,"" I was struck by the intimacy of the establishment, and I must admit that the bar area felt a bit cramped. However, the modern and trendy ambiance more than made up for any minor discomfort. The subdued red lighting created an air of sophistication and elegance, and the overall vibe was one of conviviality and warmth.Once seated, I ordered the rigatoni, which was a heavenly combination of creamy sauce and tantalizing spices. The dish was presented with an artistic flair that belied the skill and creativity of the chef.Next, I decided to sample the bacon-wrapped prawns, which were both intriguing and tasty. The combination of the smoky bacon and the succulent prawns was a flavor explosion in my mouth, and while the bacon may have slightly overpowered the prawns, the dish was nonetheless a unique and enjoyable experience.To accompany my meal, I ordered a red blend wine, which was simple and elegant, with subtle notes of fruit and spice that perfectly complemented the flavors of my entrees.In conclusion, despite the small and slightly crowded nature of the establishment, ""List"" is a must-visit for any discerning foodie. The modern and trendy ambiance, combined with the exceptional culinary creations and attentive service, makes this a dining experience that is not to be missed."

Because it's so small a place it gets crowded pretty quickly, especially during their happy hours which start from 4:30. Everything on menu is half price, which, I guess, is great. But I personally prefer a dining experience not involving wait and noise.Now, once you're in you will want to start with a cocktail. I really suggest you sticking with cocktails, because I never had a good wine here. It is cheap, but because it's cheap, it's whatever. The cocktails, on the other hand are elaborated and good.Food is very tasty! I honestly suggest you try everything. Don't have favorites, but all is good."

Night time the interior is modern and chic with a red glow...though a bit too dark for my tastes. Thursday night the friendly staff quickly seated us, but I imagine Friday or Saturday this place will be crowded.$6 Glass of house red wine...can't beat that price!$10 HH Price...Handmade Gnocchi with black truffle cream...yum! $10 HH Price...Local fresh clams, herbed white wine broth...yum!$10 HH Price Columbia River steelhead(salmon), spicy cilantro pesto...yum! And this way better and bigger than the $32 salmon dinner I had a Lola!The food came out quickly which was amazing given the exceptional quality. Service was almost perfect until the very end of our meal. I know there is a labor shortage, so the bartender was helping bus for the one lone waitress. While clearing our table, she accidently splashed a bit of clam broth on my wife...opps! She gave a verbal apology. We didn't press the issue since everything was already so cheap, but it was bummer to end the evening...otherwise this place is great, and the BEST Happy Hour in Seattle!"

A+++
List,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/list-seattle?not_recommended_start=90,Whitney B.,5,08/06/2013,424,WA,"When I sit down at List, I get this sense that whenever Ikea starts feeling insecure about the reputation of their quality, they'll compensate by sticking their crap inside restaurants that serve good food. So that if ever I purchase white, plastic chairs sturdy enough to brave a Bangladeshi child and gaudy, red, plastic-looking chandeliers for my home, it'll feel like I am eating at List. I guess the more I sit on that thought, I wouldn't be totally against it. I used to be anti-tapas, just because I always viewed them as calorie-ridden appetizers you eat before you indulge in a Five Guys Bacon Cheeseburger. List has changed my mind; tapas are a novel idea. Given the flavors in every dish, it's surprisingly filling and at a great price, too. All of the food here is prepared extremely well but the main stars for me go to the Spicy Meatballs, Chilean Sea Bass, and the Bacon-wrapped Prawns. Don't put me in the same room with those things at the same time; otherwise, what will ensue is a chapter of deleted expletives.The Chilean Sea Bass is an essential fatty acid heaven on top of kale and farro. Whatever sauce they use with which to cook the farro is something I don't want to figure out but I will forego any diet to have more of this dish. The Spicy Meatballs are perfect and there are no adjectives I can use that will make it sound any less inappropriate. Something along the lines of tender, well-seasoned, and has a great sauce. I could cradle them against my bosom and read poetry to them as I tuck them into bed at night. The Bacon-wrapped Prawns is self-explanatory. Like the Bible, you just pick it up and you know where the night's going. The gnocchi and the mushroom soup deserve an honorable mention, as well. Although I am not sure I can say the gnocchi is a must-have being that it's not unique to List and it's not that satisfying because you will definitely need to order something else to complement the dish. It's worth ordering a bottle of wine during happy hour. When you polish off half the bottle in under an hour, you'll get to stumble out of the restaurant like an idiot as I do on occasion.I enjoy their limited menu because it makes it easier on me. I feel like having or being given too many choices is more suited for children under the age of 10. Also with a limited menu, it makes it a no-brainer for the chefs in the back so you get your food quickly but also with an emphasis on consistency. I've been here twice and have had about six or seven different items, all of which have been a hit thus far. It's also a bonus when you're with somebody who knows what they're talking about, as well. This is a touchy-feely, close quarters type of restaurant. When you're there, particularly the bar area, it can start feeling as if you're on a date with everybody sitting there. The music is loud and then the people respond to that by being loud. Small prices to pay for a great meal whether or not it's happy hour."

That said, it's not cheap, but you won't wind up paying $15-20 for an entree if you choose by price.

Highly recommend this one.Mussels: Soft and saucy. The mussels are cooked perfectly and the marinera-like sauce was great for dipping in.Grilled octopus salad: A must have! The octopus is so tender, I can't believe it was octopus! The salad is very citrusy, which I loved. It had quite the kick. Highly recommend this one, too, especially since this is hard to find elsewhere.Gnocchi: The little gnocchis were good, but what makes this dish great was the sauce! The black truffle sauce was very yummy. You'll want to lick the plate at the end.Desert: Ah, I tried just because it was the only dessert they had. I would skip it next time.

Brunch/lunch stops at 4:00pm. Literally everything on the menu sounded phenomenal but I ended up going with their Salmon Corn Chowder, Carne Awadallah skillet and Biscuits & Gravy! BUT it wasn't just any gravy - it was mushroom gravy with two poached eggs. So with ordering 3 things we didn't have any room for dessert which is a pity because they're cinnamon rolls looked BOMB. Make sure you save some room for dessert (I know I will next time I'm there)! But I highly recommend the 3 above dishes I was more than happy to indulge in On the drinks side, if you're a cold brew fan you HAVE to try the cold brew tonic. It's supposed to be a ""hit or miss"" but me personally thought it was amazing! Our server even gave us free pastries after the meal.

It wasn't the food, the food was good. Overpriced, but good. It wasn't our waiter, he was great. It was the hostess and even more the bartender/manager. The hostess was rude and insulted us when we pointed out that several parties had been seated out of turn ahead of us. But the manager/bartender is a complete horror show. Her name is A. Wallace and she's the bartender with a lot of tattoos. She was obnoxious, rude and belittled us in front of the restaurant for ""having a bad attitude"". Apparantly we were supposed to be happy about sitting around for nearly 2 hours waiting to be seated while we watched party after party who came after us be seated. We were supposed to be honored to have the hostess be snobby and insult us when we asked to be seated. This whole experience would have been different had the hostess just apologized for her error rather than get defensive, or if the manager had not inexplicably confronted us. She was just awful and should not be working with people in any capacity. If/when this restaruant fails, the owners can easily point to her as a big reasons why."
The Walrus and the Carpenter,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-walrus-and-the-carpenter-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Derek H.,1,8/17/2012,13,WA,"This resturant has some very serious service issues backed up by a very strong air of snobbery. As long as there are no issues that you bring up, you should enjoy your meal or you could end up with a terrible event like we did.I went to the Walrus and the Carpenter with family...party of 4. We had some delays in getting a seat due to an error made by the hostess. That error caused several other parties to get seated before us. When this error was brought up, the hostess quickly became very defensive informing us we ""don't know the science of the restaurant business"". After a few more words were said back and forth, the hostess offered to cover the first round of drinks. When we were seated, 2 glasses of Champagne where oddly placed on our table by the hostess with no interaction at all. We didn't order Champagne, and there were 4 people at our table not 2. If this was supposed to be our first round of drinks it made no sense at all. Our dinner itself was great. Our server was wonderful and the food was delicious. When the bill was brought...by the manager oddly enough...we noticed we were charged for all the drinks we ordered. We mentioned to her the issue with the hostess, as well as the offer she made and the oddly placed champagnes. I did not get the name of the manager, however she is the woman with the tattoos that I assume most every other negative review on yelp is about. She, like the hostess earlier, quickly became very defensive and rude. She mentioned that she would be willing to help us more, however she felt we were very negative. This situation with the manager was the strangest interaction I have ever had with anyone in a service position. She continued to school us, in front of the rest of the restaurant, on our attitude. She then banned us from ever returning to the resturant. During this mind wrecking event, I mentioned to the manager that this was just bizarre. That was my interaction with the manager, and that got me banned. That was it. No yelling, no foul language, nothing. My partner left the restaurant during this interaction without saying a word due to the absurdness of how we were being treated. It is sad that a beautiful restaurant with great food, and at least one great server, is doing the easiest thing to do right (the hiring of a good hostess and a service oriented manager) horribly wrong. Treat your customers well and they will spread the word about your great food. Treat them like this and you don't have to ban them because they will never return and they will spread the word about the horrible customer service. The owners really need to rethink their staffing and read the reviews on yelp. That manager is a Grimm Reaper in your restaurant, killing off your customers 4 at a time."

Some pretentious PNW restaurants no longer stoop so low as to serve cocktail sauce to accompany our pearls of the sea, but if a 70 year old man who has eaten more oysters then your entire wait and cook staff combined asks for some cocktail sauce, I don't care if you have to high tail it all the way up to Kings to steal some ketchup, but you should make it happen. And please save the lecture about the ""right"" way to eat a PNW oyster, being so ""delicate"" it requires only the most minimalist of accompaniment. Each trip my father makes out here from the last great seafood mecca of New England, I try to show him just how great the shellfish is in the PNW. Instead, you showed how out of control the snobby foodie culture has become in Seattle. While riding the great Ballard Ave bandwagon to success, you have forgotten you table manners. Respecting your elders falls much higher on the food chain than oysters."

While we appreciate the need for table turns, Joe our waiter seemed distant, uninformed on the cuisine and clearly was pushing the course rate to free up the table (""Please don't take our plates yet.""). Our primary culinary disappointments were resident with the overcooked grilled sardines, the undercooked (virtually raw and dripping with fat ) pork belly and bland cheese course (served with oiled (?) walnuts and celery slices) - we did send the pork belly back and our waiter and the kitchen staff agreed with our assessment. Our waiter did provide a free dessert course in consideration for the undercooked pork belly. On a positive culinary note the shigoku oysters, snow creek oysters and green olives were wonderful. All restaurants have off nights for service and cuisine, possibly this was so for The Walrus and the Carpenter."

We tried all of the oysters and most of the seafood items on the menu. I had hoped to try some creamy oysters from Puget Sound, so I was a bit disappointed to find rather briny ones. We liked most of the other seafood dishes, including the crudo's, fried oysters, and the clams. We did not enjoy the sardines with walnuts, however. I thought the walnuts overpowered everything and the sardines didn't taste different from canned ones.The service was excellent and I am glad to have tried this restaurant, but I would not particularly recommend it as a special place to visit."

Fortunately, they get them pretty often. My only jib is that they would have a cocktail sauce to go with the oysters. They only provide a vinegar-based sauce and horseradish.I've recently tried their geoduck crudo and their fried brussel sprouts. I'd recommend both. Couldn't get enough. I really like bringing people here. It makes you seem like you're really in the know if you take them down the long hall way. Sure, if you come around from the backside it's right there. But come on!

I would highly recommend making a reservation. This place is incredibly popular. A fantastic variety of fresh oysters My boyfriend and I had never had fresh ones like these. Honestly, we didn't know much about how many different kinds and flavors oysters can have! The menu has all the names of the different types and it can be daunting if you have little knowledge of oysters However, our server directed us to try her favorites and educated us about the sweet vs. brine-y.Every oyster we tried was shucked fresh and had been delivered that same day. The owners of the restaurant are very involved and hand pick different oysters on a daily basis! So, it is very likely there will be a different menu selection each time you visit!Atmosphere was super fun! All the tables are very close together and really made the dinner experience unique. One of my favorite items was the bread and butter ! The butter was so delicious with large rock salt in it! Highly recommended!!!"

It was so fresh and the vinegar sauce that came with it compliment it really well. It is very strong so I would recommend dipping it with your fork to taste with the oysters before pouring it right on. I think it goes really well with the after taste of the oysters. So after swallowing the oysters will I get a taste of the vinegar. The baywater sweet was my favorite! Although it was the briniest on our menu, I thought it was a mild briny with a sweet aftertaste. You can't go wrong with any of the oysters though! We also ordered the clams and they were also delicious. Cooked perfectly, sweet, in a savory sauce.

I would definitely come back and would try their happy hour."

I don't know how many dozens of oysters on the half shell we've had here over the years but it would probably be several hundred. A perfect place for a glass of wine and nibbles on sunny days after walking the streets in Ballard and I cannot recommend highly enough.A must do in Seattle and is always a hit with visiting guests.

It sort of reminds me of an old diner but is very modern and classy. This is a great spot for oysters and the staff are incredibly knowledgable on the food and cocktails.

Since they don't take reservations I made the drive over from the Eastside with my boyfriend on a Wednesday night. Arrived a little before 8pm and got a table right away. Very close seating but I cared about the food AND IT DIDN'T DISAPPOINT! Loved the endive salad! Best beef tartare I've ever had! And the bread and butter were totally worth the add on price. Oh and AMAZING OYSTERS!! (no surprise!) So glad I made it to this Seattle favorite! The bars within the building look darling too so if I go on a weekend I think the wait will be a fun one.

Arrive long before you intend to eat. They don't take reservations, but will put down your number and call when your table is open. They like to scare newbies away by saying it will take 2+ hours for a table. Usually it's much faster. The oysters are top notch. But the small plates are what set them apart from your standard oyster house. I have yet to have a bad dish. The food is creative, fresh and different."

We had such an awesome experience we just had to go back the next day! The atmosphere is bustling and lively. I really liked the open kitchen where you can see the staff at work. My water glass was always full and the service was excellent. We got there early thinking we'd beat the wait, but everyone else had the same idea. The nice thing is there is a great bar next door that serves nice wines and appetizers while you wait.The waitress at the Walrus and the Carpenter made great suggestions for wine and was one of the most knowledgeable people about wine that I've come across. We ordered the scallop tartare, olives, Dinah's cheese, cabbage salad, dried trout, sardines, and octopus. For dessert we had the bread pudding. My recommendations are the oysters, the sardines, and the padron peppers. The cabbage salad was excellent with the sardines. Check it out! You won't be disappointed."

I talk about The Walrus and the Carpenter to anyone who will listen. I've encouraged all of my fellow New Yorkers to go to Seattle simply for this restaurant, which is located in the Ballard neighborhood but could easily be mistaken for parts of hipster and ""it""-scene Brooklyn.The local west coast oysters were shucked perfectly and were the freshest I've ever had. But I knew I was going to get good oysters, so I was equally thrilled by the other dishes and drinks on the menu. You can't go wrong with shishito peppers if they're on the menu toward the end of summer. And if you see the fennel salad on the menu, too, be sure to order it. I've been trying to recreate it in my own home for nearly a year now. Finally, save room for dessert. Fresh blueberry panna cotta melted in my mouth and was the perfect ending to a fantastic meal."

The two of us have never been self-proclaimed oyster connoisseurs, but we do have an affinity for all forms of seafood and shellfish, so we decided to give it a try. The location is hidden within Ballard, and while I don't think I'd want to be walking around there solo at night, the isolation does add to the charm. Lucky for us, we arrived around 5:30pm on a Tuesday (thirty minutes before happy hour ended) and only had to wait for five minutes. Still, it was surprisingly crowded. We ended up sitting at the bar, which I highly recommend if you're just casually going with a friend or date. As you can probably see from all the photos, the interior is intimate, yet bright and lively. Sitting at the bar truly added to this experience. I will admit, that type of dining environment isn't for everyone, and it isn't for every type of occasion, but for a post-work happy hour, it was perfectly light-hearted. My date & I decided to share a variety of plates: we started off with two of each oyster (one for each of us). As we were still there for happy hour, the oysters were less expensive (I believe 20% off, coming in around $1.50 per oyster). The oysters were tasty, but honestly, I probably don't know a superb oyster from a really good one. Those fried oysters, however, were to die for. You must order the fried oysters. The bartender suggested a Muscadet to pair with our meal, which ended up being a perfect addition; we ordered a pichet (about 55% of a bottle) that was happy hour priced. A lot of people have voted against ordering bread, but I'd actually suggest getting it. No, it isn't anything incredible, but it broke up our meal well and was used for soaking up the excess aioli from our fried oysters."

And yet, dammit, here I am doing just that.On several occasions- not just once- the place has nailed it across the board. Service, beverages, and the oysters- oh the oysters! Without a doubt the best selection and quality in the city.I do hope that someday they will be allowed to wipe out the parking lot that their patio sits in- wait!

Sometimes the gems are hidden, and I'd have no problem climbing a broken ladder to eat here again (or maybe just to have a late cocktail.) The staff is professional and attentive. I wish I remembered our server's name. :( My friend and I ate here months ago and we really enjoyed ourselves. The oysters, the small plates, the cocktails, and dessert were all fantastic to say the least. My favorite dish was the pork crepinette with romesco (recommended by a friend) and of course the Oysters! They had Fernet so I was pleased! The open kitchen gives a homey vibe, and the intimate ambiance feels pretty dang good...not to mention, it's beautifully designed...simple and elegant. It's one of my new favorite spots in Seattle."

We have not had oysters that fresh in a long time except maybe at the Brooklyn oyster bar downtown. My favorite oyster was a Pacific larger size that began with a T. We where able to get a seat up @ the bar to watch the clever shuckers and bartenders mixing up the love we where about to devour. Cool Decor.We can not wait to go back soon. Wonder if they will ever offer a oyster wine/stout/ or vodka ""flight"" in the near future? I am a big FAN of the Flight pairings but will just have to keep checking back in the meantime. We look forward to hanging out on the the deck out back with a group of our oyster loving friends to sample everything. everything on the menu."

What more does a man need? Service is impeccable. Fried oysters, smoked trout, mussels, and chantrelles were out of this world.

You literally bought the recipes from the owners, why not stick to them? Take the flavors and portions they pushed out and add takeout - you will see a healthy profit AND a loyal fan base. For now, I'm holding off on this place again until they find the essence of their food, again."

None of the dishes stood out. Kerabu Mangga - the mix of ripe and semi ripe mangoes in the salad didn't work, i was so excited to order it. The fried rice was too salty to taste on its own. It came with a sweet chilli sauce which was helpful. The pork ribs were good, but they were dry. I had heard good things about this place but maybe we caught them on a bad day."

The new location has its pros (much bigger, almost no wait times, nice ambience) but seems to be missing what the original was known for--fantastic food. While the menu is similar, the quality of the food has gone downhill at the new location and the prices have gone up. The texture of the roti net bread was off, the dhal was super oily and missing the depth of flavor it once had, and the nasi goreng could best be described as ""okay"". The new location might be worth trying for an introduction to Malaysian food, but if you've visited the old, I'm not sure it'll live up to expectations. I was really looking forward to seeing this place come back to life, but I will not be returning."

I would say this place partially succeeded in doing the job. I think it's a 3.5*, here is why -Ordered -Kerabu Timun Nanas : cold salad heavily loaded with peanuts and some curry powder I guess. Pineapple and cucumber are my favorite things on this world and this salad ruined it for me.Cocolife : rum, coconut cream and curry powder? Looks interesting right? Tasted like 2/5. Highly not recommended.Roti Jala: sounds like an Indian origin. Best of all the dishes I ordered. If you have tried rice crepes before, roti just tastes like that. Side of dal tasted delicious though.Malay fried peanuts: flavored peanuts that are crispy and tasty.Wait times are crazy, waited close to 1.5hrs.

Tikka masala chicken katsu was an interesting fusion dish. It was good but not something I feel like i need to get again. I think I like the loco moco with scotch egg more. Seems like their menu rotates though since I didn't see some of the items I saw on yelp on their menu. Food was definitely on the pricier side but maybe thats expected from this being more of a bar? 3.5/5

For a party of two, we definitely ordered more with our eyes, but everything just sounded so good that it was hard not to! We had the oysters, Seattle dog musubi, and loco moco scotch egg. The loco moco scotch egg was actually so filling that I had a good amount of leftovers. Looking forward to returning soon since service was friendly and attentive, and the food was tasty. I still need to try the oxtail risotto and tikka tonkatsu don!Highly recommend making reservations in advance, as the restaurant tends to get full pretty often."

While there were some remarkable highlights, a few minor areas held back what could have been a perfect dining experience.First and foremost, the Nasi Lemak was a delightful choice, and opting for the tofu option turned out to be a great decision. The dish was flavorful and authentically prepared, showcasing the kitchen's skill in crafting this Malaysian classic.The Roti Jala with chicken curry was not only very good but also visually appealing. The intricate lace-like pattern of the Roti Jala added an extra layer of charm to the dish, and the accompanying chicken curry was rich and savory.However, the real star of the meal was the Chili Pan Mee. It stood out as the best among the dishes we tried. The flavors were explosive, and the noodles were cooked to perfection, maintaining just the right level of consistency. It's a must-try for those seeking a flavorful punch in their meal.On a positive note, the restaurant honored our check-in and offered us a delightful treat to end our meal: coconut ice cream.

I guess they have to serve a crowd, so they do it fast and come out of it remains uncooked. And some part of it was a little burnt, assuming it got overcooked a little.We enjoyed our dinner here. The food was delicious, and the staff was friendly and helpful. The site was comfortable to dine in, so simple, and everyone was hospitable. The food took 20 minutes to come out."

Kedai Makan,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kedai-makan-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=20,Sienna S.,4,09/05/2017,6,WA,"I have been here several times and there is always a crazy wait. I recently tried out the No Wait app to ""get in line"" rather than actually get in line. The only problem is that you can't get in line until the restaurant opens. I used the app 30min after the restaurant opened on a Tuesday evening and still had to wait almost 2 hours to be seated. Plan on getting pre-dinner drinks at the bars around the corner if you decide to come here. The food is always amazing and makes you feel like the wait was worth it. The menu seems to be slightly different every time I visit so I am always trying something new. I recently had some very spicy and crispy chicken wings. the Jala bread was very delicate and almost melted in my mouth with the curry (?) dipping sauce. For my entree, I enjoyed the nashi goering (?). The food is always hot, always delicious, and heats up well the next day for more goodness. While the food is great, service is sub par. Waitors seems to enjoy plenty of relaxed conversations with each other at the bar while my throat is burning since I seem to never have my water refilled...Would very much appreciate a bit more attentive service. The restaurant is always packed and hiring an extra bus boy/water boy would make a huge difference in service."

Last night I had the pleasure of dining here and their food did not disappoint. Soul food classics get a delicious upgrade with fresh local seafood and ingredients. I devoured my seafood boil with a side of greens and can't wait to go back to try some new dishes (they update their menu according to what's fresh in season). I absolutely love the ambiance too.

The bonus meal you get from leftovers are icing on an already delectable cake of carbs, carbs, and more delicious carbs.If you're looking for something extra special (in a unique way, not a you'll-necessarily-like-it way), try the Chinese herb-infused shots.

Oh no, Not giving this to the servers, but pocketing for pure profit. Unscrupulous to wait to the end of the meal to tell us. What's the issue? Can't compete fairly with other real restaurants??? Looser management. Never go to Elliott's or any other E3 owned restaurant. Unbelievable, truly"""

He was very rude and stereotyped us right from the start! Told us they weren't taking walk-ins and while we were literally standing right there he offered 4 other people walk-in spots!  He also turned the Asian guy away!  How can he be LBGTQ and still judge people? He should know better about being judged.  Such a shame! If zero stars were an option I would have gladly entered it.

There's no sign about this charge and you'll find out on the receipt when you are paying. You end up paying over 40% to the total when you include gratuity for your server.

Elliott's Oyster House,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/elliotts-oyster-house-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Donna V.,1,06/06/2018,1,WA,"While I was dining at Elliot's Oyster House, I witnessed the most appalling scene. Near my table, a man was being interviewed for a serving job. The hiring manager, at a certain point, said to the applicant, ""Look around at the servers. We don't hire your kind here."" The applicant was a black man. The applicant had a friend (maybe partner? unsure) with him who immediately got up to leave. The applicant replied to the hiring manager by saying, ""You can't talk to me like that, sir. That is out of line."" The hiring manager replied with, ""You know what? We don't even like serving your kind here,"" and promptly kicked the applicant and his companion out of the restaurant. I quickly asked for the check and left the restaurant. I don't care how good the food is or isn't, I vow to never support this restaurant again. If I had ever known that they employ racists and ask those racists to hire based on skin color, I never would have set foot in the establishment in the first place. The sheer audacity that a hiring manager felt comfortable having this conversation in the dining area, within earshot of paying customers, is indicative of the kind of insidious racism that can't be pinned on one solitary employee. Elliot's can't do anything to make up for this. I can't imagine what the culture is like in the kitchen, where the line staff is likely entirely composed of people of color. Will never set foot in here again and highly encourage everyone to reconsider spending their money in a place that discriminates against the African American community."

The restaurant is located in a very touristy location, which takes away from the experience. Oysters: The oysters all tasted the same and were not particularly memorable. There are better places for oysters in Seattle. Appetizers: The calamari is frozen, not fresh, which the waitress was forthcoming about when we asked. We did not order it. The crab cakes were fine, but not remarkable. I ordered the Cioppino for the main course. The fish was tough--I did not like the texture and was not sure how fresh the fish was.

The oysters were fantastic, especially with the awesome toppings they came with. The mussels were great, and the crab cakes were delish. The salmon Caesar was also very tasty.The views from the patio are lovely, which definitely added to our experience. The service, on the other hand, was just okay. It started off pretty slow, and unfortunately, our server forgot to bring the spicy crab & corn chowder we were excited to try. But overall, we still had a good experience!"

Elliott's Oyster House,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/elliotts-oyster-house-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=10,Paul K.,3,5/27/2023,47,FL,"We recently dined at Elliott's Oyster House during our Seattle visit and our experience was a mixed bag. Let's start with the beverages - I ordered an Old Fashioned and Amy had a glass of cider. The Old Fashioned was quite disappointing. Note to all restaurants - don't serve this classic cocktail without a single ice cube, it's a major faux pas.We kicked off our meal with an assortment of oysters. It's fascinating how different oysters can taste depending on their origin, and as someone who prefers ones that carry the taste of the sea, this was a treat. The Ahi Tuna Tacos were next - they were perfectly portioned and tasted incredibly fresh.The Seafood Pasta was a hearty and rich dish, with shellfish taking center stage. However, my wife Amy wished there had been more shrimp. The seasonal specialty, a Halibut dish, came served with fresh vegetables and was full of flavor.But here's where things get tricky - Elliott's Oyster House is not easy on the wallet. The prices are quite steep, and to add to that, there's a mandatory 20% service charge added to the bill. The check mentions that part of this charge is shared with the service staff, who are paid a competitive wage. But what's unclear is the exact portion of the service charge that actually goes to the staff. In comparison, other similar establishments often explicitly outline what percentage of the service charge goes to the wait staff. Without this knowledge, customers like us are left wondering if we should tip more and whether the servers are actually benefitting from the service charge. In conclusion, while the food at Elliott's Oyster House is truly wonderful, the service charge practices leave you with an unsavory aftertaste. It's a real pity, as such issues detract from an otherwise great dining experience."

The place is big and busy, filled with tourists. But there's no special class to the presentation, nor anything but standard fare on the menu. Swordfish - with potato salad and mustard.

We ordered the clam linguini, the seafood risotto, a couple of the fish a chips, a glass of wine and strawberry lemonade. We all felt the food was very tasty, packed with quality and fresh seafood. A good wine selection allowed for a good glass of wine and the strawberry lemonade was a hit with the kiddo in our party. But for the location, the up an coming newly revamped Seattle water front, this place fell short in terms of style and even cleanliness. The carpet throughout the place is truly done after way too many years of service, and the bathrooms were truly way out of sync with the location, menu prices and reputation of the place. So they loose a star (should have been minus 2 stars but wanted to be more lenient). The bathrooms were for sure fairly dirty, but the food still made up for the decaying ambiance. Hopefully it gets a lift sometime soon. P.S. the staff was welcoming, very nice and efficient.Thanks"

Eating them & then finishing it up with the dessert like Chinook salmon aka King Salmon alder planked prepared medium rare with beurre blanc & the season's fresh vegetables was surely a dessert of its own, as it is seldom noticed as one, whilst finishing sweet down my gullet with Omega 3 oily fats in the finest way possible. If I could see the merry catch hauled off the Puget Sound whilst eating the very catch, bait & shelled crustaceans as they're coming off the boat from the Pacific Ocean, then it would have surely been a more superlative sight to behold, & I may have added another star, so catch that. ;-) Being one of the tourist venues notwithstanding garners it one less star. Just eat, chat with the knowledgeable shuckers & then shlurppp some more, & then what? Then proceed outward bound hastily walking out from Elliott's, which is packed like sardines with the general ill-informed tourist populace popping their heads in here thinking this is THE place where locals go, & then constantly bobbing their heads in disbelief like the buoys you can also see out in the water. :-PGood, attentive service followed by the charging of my phone was even better than the real catch. ;-)"

Those slimy gooey sexy little briny bivalves! OMG. I think the oysters here were definitely the highlight of our self-guided Seattle food and drink tour. Pretty cool little happy hour deal on them too - I think they start at like 75 cents each and then increase every half hour. Unfortunately, we got there at the last half hour, so by that time they were $1.75 each, but damn, they were worth it. And the oyster shucker (oyster tender?) knew a LOT about all of them, giving us samples of his favorites as we dined at the bar. It's a swanky spot for sure, perhaps a bit outside of our swank range, but we sat at the bar with a drink and some happy hour oysters (and other appetizers which were less memorable, including the babiest sized mussels I have ever seen! - slightly disappointing) and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. So I say to you, Yelpers, go there for happy hour. Get there early and fill yourselves with many, many deliciously glistening oysters. They're good for you!"

Elliott's Oyster House,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/elliotts-oyster-house-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=80,Petey O.,4,5/13/2011,9,CA,"First stop in must do things in Seattle was the .50 cent oyster HH that runs Monday thru Friday. The way it works is starting at 3pm the HH prices are .50 cents each with a 3 dozen per table limit on the order. If you finish the ones you order you can order more but depending on the currnet time each half hour the price increases by .25 cents. Factors like the time to place the order and have the oysters shucked plus eat time can slow the glutany process down. At 4 when we finally made it there and got a table the price was already $1 per oyster, not terrible but not quite the price we had been shooting for so curse you broken GPS, Seattle freeway system, Seattle parking machines and man who took extra 20 mins at the table which we were waiting for at the bar......Yeah I know better planning should have been happening here but we were dying to try em. We also got $3 beers, oyster shooters and a few other appetizers for $3 each. The Salmon Slider was really awesome in my opinion but the fish taco was just ok. I liked the oyster but I didn't love them and I felt the sizes were not consistent but over all I would love to just stuff myself on .50 cent oysters next visit."

After wandering up and down the pier looking for a restaurant that my friend wanted to go to that he couldn't remember the name of, or where it was, or what it looked like, we settled on Elliot's.The food was great, and the waitstaff was very attentive. We started with the Appetizer Tower, which the waiter seemed a little shocked that we wanted that much food between the two of us for our APPETIZER, but neither of us had eaten anything all day, and hell, we were in for an adventure. I didn't try any of the calamari, but my friend said that it was very good, and I really enjoyed the crab cakes, and the dip was good as well. Ate my appetizers with a very tasty Lemon Drop.For entrees, I had the King Salmon and chips, he had the Blackened Rockfish. I'd never had breaded salmon before, and while it was good, it left a little to be desired taste-wise. The Rock Fish I was told was tasty, but could've tasted a little Blacker. Had my entree with the best Mai Tai I've ever had!For dessert, I had the Granny Smith Apple Napoleon, which was AMAZING, despite not a hazelnut to be seen. My friend had the Deep Fried Truffle Sundae, which I had a bite of and thought was very good.Finished the meal with some Kenyan coffee to sober us up enough to make it to our next destination :)All and all, it was a very good dining experience. They do get docked a star though do to our complaints (listed above) about the entrees, and the fact that while there was not another person out of the bar/lounge area, they still tried to hide us (a very pierced, tattooed, brightly colored duo) in the furthest table in the back."

The definition of a hole-in-the-wall. I got the regular hamburger and wow... there are no words. A classic burger done right. Crisp bun, juicy patty, stuffed with all the essentials (ketchup, shredded lettuce, tomato, and pickles). There's about a million options available between the menu board and wall full of specials, so it can get a little overwhelming, but you really can't go wrong. Not much else to say besides go see for yourself! You won't be disappointed."

The oysters are very good, this is the place where you get the freshest produce from the market. The menu is easy to follow and the waiters are very pleasant and easy to work with. They don't give any attitude and will take good care of you. I never thought that I would be able to differentiate between various types of oysters before I started coming here but I was pleasantly surprised. There are a lot of tourists that stop in but it's one of the best attractions in Seattle. It can get a little busy so you need to know when to go, otherwise the service is quick and enjoyable. Its' also clean considering how many people stop in every day. If you are looking for the freshest oysters, go there and you will not be disappointed."

We were seated by a corner glass window overlooking the Puget Sound, with the sun, boats, and Bainbridge Island in the background. The wait staff was very courteous and attentive, and their recommendations on the menu were very helpful. We had the smoked salmon linguine and Rockfish tacos, along with an oyster sampler. The champagne topping for the oyster sampler went well with the oysters, without overpowering them. The salmon linguine was delicious and a generous portion size, due to being so rich! I actually had trouble finishing it. The Rockfish tacos were delicious and had a very fun presentation - the redness of the very large cut of Rockfish was an eye-catcher. The texture was perfect - most and just flakey enough. The atmosphere and food were top notch, and the setting can't be beat. I would take any newcomer to Seattle here for a real experience of Seattle living!"

Nah....food is not the same as it was before. This will be good only for those who never tried real Georgian food in Georgia. Very sad. It was delicious before and the server was a very friendly and cool guy too as other servers. Now it's all suck. SAD."

I was there today with my girlfriend, and we ordered the same food, but the taste was different. I'm not sure why but it does not taste the same anymore. Very disappointed. Of course, people who never tried this food before will be good to them, but those who have been already eaten this food before will see the difference right away. I hope you guys will bring back the same authentic taste as it was before."

Skalka,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/skalka-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Bryanna R.,1,2/21/2021,7,GA,"I recently visited shalka and found their concept to be quite unique. The food itself was absolutely delicious, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, I do have a few concerns regarding the service that I would like to address, which is why I am deducting a few stars from my overall rating.One issue I encountered was the opening time. Despite the advertised opening time of 9AM, the door was already open for guests to enter before that. It was a bit confusing as we were told that they don't officially open until 9AM, even though we were allowed to hang out inside until then. This inconsistency in their opening procedure was a little frustrating.Additionally, there was a situation where someone placed an order at 8:48AM, and they were told that they needed to wait until 9AM. This kind of miscommunication or refusal of service after the official opening time can be quite off-putting for customers.Lastly, when we wanted to share our meals, we realized that there were no knives available. It would have been more convenient if the restaurant had provided all the necessary utensils to enjoy the meal properly.In order to enhance the overall experience, I would suggest that shalka ensures that their doors are not opened before the official opening time if they are not ready to serve customers yet. Consistency in adhering to the advertised opening hours would greatly improve the customer experience. Additionally, it would be beneficial for them to ensure that all necessary utensils are readily available for customers, especially if sharing meals is encouraged."
Skalka,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/skalka-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Veronica L.,3,5/27/2023,67,WA,"This place does bread bowls right! The filling is delicious--cheesy, flavorful, and super satisfying. They offer options for everyone, with chicken, beef, or vegan choices, so there's something for every preference. Each bread bowl is made to order, keeping it nice and crispy on the outside while perfectly holding all that tasty goodness inside. The place itself is clean and set up for self-service, from ordering to cleanup, which makes it an easy, casual stop. Definitely worth a visit if you're craving a hearty, well-made bread bowl!"
Skalka,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/skalka-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Abhijit S.,4,11/01/2024,88,WA,"Despite frequently passing by this restaurant, it was my first visit, inspired by rave reviews. I decided to go for brunch on a Saturday, but the timing coincided with the Seafair Torchlight Parade, which led to most streets being closed. After 30 minutes of searching, I found street parking nearly a mile away and walked to the restaurant.**Ambiance**:The restaurant has large floor-to-ceiling windows that let in plenty of natural light, creating an airy and welcoming atmosphere. The decor is funky and fun, adding to the overall charm.**Ordering Process**:I ordered at a kiosk and provided my phone number, which felt unnecessary. It would be more customer-friendly to use numbered tokens instead of collecting personal information. After ordering, the food was brought to my table, and there were no further interactions with the staff during my meal.**Food**:I ordered a Lobiani, which consisted of red beans, runny eggs, bacon, banana peppers, and butter melting into the cheese alongside the egg yolk. Initially, I was unsure how to eat it, but I decided to chip away at the fresh and fluffy bread and use a fork for the filling. Once it was small enough, I used my hands. Although it didn't look very big, it was quite filling, and I had some leftovers.**Taste**:The food was good, but it didn't live up to the rave reviews that had set my expectations very high. It reminded me of a pizza, especially with the egg yolk and two handle-like protrusions on each side. However, it was still enjoyable and satisfying.**Value**:The price was around $18, which seemed reasonable for the portion and quality.**Conclusion**:I have nothing bad to say about the food, but it wasn't as mind-blowing as some reviews claimed. Despite that, I'm a sucker for breakfast restaurants and wouldn't hesitate to return."
Skalka,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/skalka-seattle-4?not_recommended_start=0,Stephanie G.,4,7/27/2024,473,CA,"Nestled on the outskirts of Pikes Place in Seattle, Skalka offers a delightful culinary experience with a scenic backdrop that complements its unique approach to dining. The restaurant's commitment to delicious food and an innovative online ordering system makes it a standout in the bustling Seattle food scene.One of the notable features of Skalka is its picturesque location, providing a charming escape from the urban hustle. The ambiance is perfect for those seeking a break from the Pike's Place touristy noise.Skalka takes an unconventional approach to ordering, with the entire process conducted online. While this may be a novel concept, it does streamline the ordering process, ensuring efficiency and accuracy. However, this approach might not suit everyone, especially those who prefer a more traditional experience with face-to-face interaction.The menu at Skalka boasts a variety of delectable options, showcasing a fusion of flavors that cater to diverse palates. The Chicken Boat seemed a bit overwhelming and a bit to ummm mushy. In hindsight, opting for the Cheese Boat alone might have been a wiser choice, as it allowed the individual ingredients to shine without the slight overcrowding observed in the Chicken Boat.While the food at Skalka is undoubtedly a highlight, the service could use a friendlier touch. The online ordering system, while efficient, lacks the personal interaction that many patrons seek in a dining experience. A bit more warmth and engagement from the staff could elevate the overall satisfaction for guests. If the restaurant could enhance its service with a more personable touch, it would undoubtedly secure its place as a must-visit destination on the outskirts of Pikes Place in Seattle."

2120,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/2120-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Chenghao L.,1,12/17/2018,40,IL,Bad service. Bad server with impolite attitude. Very racist restaurant. Always ignore Asian faces and lie that they don't provide this or that even yelp shows other customers are taking the same service. Don't go. Try somewhere else.
2120,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/2120-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Steven L.,1,09/07/2018,7,WA,"I decided to check this place out while I was downtown checking out the biospheres. A weird latin influenced menu which doesn't seem to be figured out yet. The chef seems confused. The cocktails are ok, however there bartender seemed almost irritated that he had to serve me and wasn't very knowledgeable for the food. He was very rude. If your in the hospitality business, shouldn't you not serve with a smile. The location & design are the only reason its getting any star. Underwhelming indeed."
2120,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/2120-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Lam H.,1,07/06/2017,20,WA,"Having visited the 2120 establishment with girl, I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere that reigned in this place. The cool and cozy atmosphere created a special mood for the evening. The service also deserves the highest praise - the staff was attentive and friendly. However, there is one point that slightly clouded my experience. After trying the Prime New York Steak, I ordered it Well Done. Unfortunately, the dish was brought medium rare. But it is worth nothing that when I brought this error to the attention of the waiter, the problem was promptly corrected.Thus, despite a small glitch with the order, the overall impression of the 2120 establishment remained positive."
2120,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/2120-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Marianna K.,3,02/12/2024,54,WA,"I visited the restaurant for a mid-week dinner. I had made a reservation a few weeks in advance and arrived slightly late due to traffic. Thankfully, they accommodated us, but requested that we finish by a specific time, which was fine as we had enough time. A nice touch was the free parking available in the same building after 4 pm.The restaurant was quite busy, and it took a while before someone noticed us and took our reservation. However, once we were attended to, the service was smooth. The closely spaced tables contributed to noticeable noise levels, but it wasn't unbearable.We started with some small dishes, which arrived quickly. However, our main courses took a bit longer. We ordered six items, but only one stood out for me, and I would consider ordering it again: the calamari. The green salad was good but rather simple, consisting of greens, strawberries, and crumbled cheese with a tasty vinaigrette. It was enjoyable but not quite at the level I expected.The calamari was very good, with the highlight being the yogurt sauce (though it was labeled as labneh, it wasn't as sour as traditional Mediterranean labneh). The warm spices added a nice touch.The pork belly roulette was disappointing and felt like a calorie waste.I had high hopes for the steak tartar, but it turned out to be overly sour, with the sourness overshadowing the gentle sweetness of the yolk. The textures of the meat and the popping mustard seeds were interesting, but the sourness was too much for my taste.My husband ordered the rack of lamb, which tasted very good but was rather small for its $62 price tag, consisting of only two chops and some veggies.The cream puff had a moderate sweetness level, which was appreciated. However, I found the cream both inside and outside to be overly fatty, with just a hint of fruit filling in the middle. I would have preferred a better balance with less cream and more filling.Despite the restaurant's great reviews, I don't plan on returning."
2120,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/2120-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Libby B.,4,6/24/2019,22,WA,I liked this place a lot! I came in for brunch and the food/ drink aesthetic was very pretty and the flavors were very well mixed too! It is also across the street from the Amazon spheres and that was neat. The one downside I really had was that my poached eggs were really over cooked and that's never fun. But I'd definitely be open to coming back!
2120,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/2120-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Christine P.,5,06/03/2024,28,WA,"A solid salad, enough to fill you up although I don't think they give as much as evergreens does. Here, I'd stick to a preset menu item over individually ordering because so many things cost extra that it's too much to keep track of. The harvest salad was definitely yummy but I really couldn't tell you how I ended up paying $20 for it. I feel like sweetgreen is cool because it's the prototype for these types of salad places but holy moly I don't want to pay this much for a bowl of kale."
2120,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/2120-seattle?not_recommended_start=10,Steve M.,5,06/01/2024,353,CA,"I recently dined at 2120, an upscale casual restaurant located inside the Amazon One building, the birthplace of Jeff Bezos' empire. The ambience inside is warm and modern, with about thirty tables and a bar that seats around ten to fifteen people. The restaurant also boasts a very nice patio that overlooks a globe building, adding to its aesthetic appeal.The highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the food and the service. I started with the carrots as an appetizer, which had a surprising texture similar to a baked potato rather than traditional carrots. For the main course, I had the scallops, which were absolutely amazing--tender and delicious, served with a curry and cumin sauce that was out of this world and really highlighted the dish. We also tried the Belgian frites, which were crispy and flavorful, clearly benefitting from their double-frying process.Our server, Will, was excellent. He was attentive without being overbearing, allowing us to enjoy our meal at a comfortable pace. He had great wine recommendations and picked out an incredible dessert for us, carrot cake, which was a perfect end to a wonderful meal. Will truly enhanced our dining experience with his professionalism and expertise.Overall, I highly recommend 2120 for its outstanding food, inviting atmosphere, and exceptional service."

This place had me drooling, and questioning why I hadn't discovered it sooner. Brace yourself for an epic culinary adventure that will leave your belly satisfied!Let's talk about the braised lamb cacciatore, shall we? It was so good that I momentarily forgot my own name. The lamb was so tender, it practically serenaded me with a love ballad as I took my first bite. The tomato sauce was so rich, it had more flavor than a Shakespearean tragedy. I half-expected the chef to burst out of the kitchen and take a bow for this masterpiece. Seriously, they should consider selling tickets to this lamb extravaganza--it's that good!And oh, the pumpkin puff! It was like the dessert gods decided to throw a party in my mouth. The puff pastry was so light and fluffy; I swear it had levitation powers. The pumpkin filling was like a magic potion brewed by a mischievous wizard. One bite, and I was under its spell--complete with giggles, swoons, and a longing for more. Move over Cinderella, this pumpkin creation is the real star of the fairytale!The ambiance was the cherry on top of this feast. The lighting was dim enough to create an intimate atmosphere, but not so dim that I couldn't see my food (because let's be honest, that would be a tragedy).To sum it up, 2120 is the place where culinary excellence. The braised lamb cacciatore and pumpkin puff are the headliners of this comedy show for your taste buds. The staff deserves a standing ovation for their top-notch service. So, bring your appetite, and get ready to feast on delicious food at 2120. It's a culinary adventure you won't soon forget!"

Looking at it from that lens, 2120's salmon would melt apart if you were to simply blow on it like a candle. It was buttery smooth, fatty, with almost no need to chew. It was perfection and I am already planning a return when back in Seattle later this year. Amazing food aside, I also want to shoutout their private dining service. Our group of 20 was welcomed to our dining room with a signature cocktail, a three-course menu imprinted with our names, and friendly service that didn't miss a beat.Highly recommend as a must-visit dinner restaurant."

I had the roasted delicata bowl and my friend had the Caesar salad with shrimp. Both were very good and full of flavor, and the portion sizes were generous. We each had a glass of ros�, which was also nice (I like that their wine list is Washington focused). Our food came out in a timely fashion, and our server was very pleasant.

They have a nice selection of sandwiches, which they had previously, but also added a new Salads & Bowls section that has some yummy sounding dishes. It looks like the bulk of the new dishes have vegetarian options too. I had the roasted delicata dish, and it was very good! Full of flavor, and quite filling.

I've tried both the dinner and brunch menus, both of which I liked. The lunch menu was also quite good. I like the addition of their ""Bowls & Salads"" section, as it adds a nice, light option. Each of the dishes come with the option to add a protein (salmon, shrimp, or chicken), which is great, and I believe that they all come as vegetarian options by default (with out the added proteins, of course!). I had the quinoa bowl with shrimp, and it was very tasty, and filling, but not heavy. I like that I was able to get in an out for lunch at well under an hour too. I'll be back for sure."

The ambience is so cool.. right on the water and cool lighting. So much more sophisticated than Belltown, but with the mix of crowd (all different ages because it's in a hotel) it never seems pretentious. I've seen various music acts here most of which were fabulous... too good to be free! And the bartenders and wait staff are great (especially Lee at the bar).  The only reason I don't give 5 stars is that the drinks are on the spendy side, and they have to shut the music down at midnight."

The food is also very good but expect to shell out some clams at dinner. Breakfast and lunch are a much better value.

They took care of customers and gave great service while keeping the drinks flowing for the dining room. Also, I need to give a shout-out to the guy cleaning up in the lodge area; he also did a great job.The food is top-notch, though-it's a bit on the high side, price-wise. A main course will be about $50-60. Expect to spend in the region of $150-200 dinner for two, including drinks. I had the clam chowder, and it was great. Seafood mix and steak were great, nice and done.The only downside would be that the place feels a little old, but that is not really a big deal."

The restaurant is located in a beautiful waterfront setting, offering stunning views of the Seattle skyline and Elliott Bay. The ambiance is sophisticated and elegant, making it a perfect choice for a special occasion or a romantic evening.The menu at Six Seven Restaurant features a variety of culinary delights. I had the opportunity to try their seafood dishes, and they were delicious. The flavors were well-balanced, and the presentation was impeccable. The freshness of the ingredients was evident in every bite, and the seafood was cooked to perfection.The service at Six Seven Restaurant was exceptional. The staff was attentive, and knowledgeable, and provided excellent recommendations. They were also mindful of dietary restrictions and accommodated special requests with ease.In addition to the wonderful food and service, the restaurant offers an extensive wine list and a well-crafted cocktail menu. The sommelier was helpful in suggesting pairings that enhanced the dining experience.The only minor drawback was that the prices at Six Seven Restaurant are on the higher side, reflecting the upscale dining experience and waterfront location. However, considering the quality of the food, service, and ambiance, it was a worthwhile investment.Overall, I would highly recommend Six Seven Restaurant to those looking for an elegant dining experience in Seattle. The combination of exquisite cuisine, impeccable service, and breathtaking views make it a standout restaurant that truly showcases the best of the city."

Having had dinner multiple times here before in their main dinning area, the food was more than impressive. The view is picturesque and the food is exceptional- for all intents and purposes, this was a great place for a wedding reception. While the overall picture was great, the Catering Team GAVE THEIR WEDDING CAKE AWAY.The cake was bought through Palisade made through a local vendor, Dessert Works, with whom they had a cake tasting months prior like most couples do. The assistant manager came up to the BRIDE during the pictures and said that 'WE' have a problem. They had lost the cake.The bride and groom were nothing but pleasant and accommodating (what else were they supposed to do?) and had their ceremony. During the reception, the assistant manager again spoke to the bride and said that after investigating the matter, they had concluded the cake was GIVEN TO THE ANOTHER WEDDING RECEPTION THE NIGHT BEFORE. He proceeded to describe that 'WE' had two options: a cake from QFC (he misspoke and meant Whole Foods- imagine the astonishment) or cupcakes from Cupcake Royale. The Bride and Groom chose cupcakes and did not elude to their company of the unfortunate mistake as most of the guests thought this was their choice for dessert. Although many people choose cupcakes for their reception, this was not the cake they chose. After more investigating, Dessert Works did their job and delivered what could only be imagined to be a wonderful cake that another wedding party got to enjoy (were they VIP?) because the bride and groom's name was on the cake box according to Dessert Works.Palisade compensated in various ways but you can not replicate the moment or pictures of your wedding day again."

THIS IS THE ONLY RESTARAUNT I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN KICKED OUT OF! Why? Simply because I asked an obviously overworked doorman why my car hadn't been brought out for us when many others behind us in line were being brought their car?! He accused me of ""touching him"" on the shoulder. I was with a company christmas party in 2008, and EVERYONE WAS APPAULED. Needless to say I will never return. ALSO! Take notice that the people most excited about the restaraunt ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE. They often seem overwhelmed with satisfaction of their own restaraunt, snobbish. If you go, see if you agree....Oh! AND DEFINATELY DON'T USE THE VALET!!! Much better optioin is SALTY'S restaraunt in West Seattle, especially for Sunday brunch. Unlike the Palisades, it's an open buffet of EVERYTHING...meat, seafood, omelette bar, NOT JUST PANCAKES!"

The food quality was very disappointing. I had the surf and turf and ordered my steak medium rare. It came after a long 45+ minute wait, only to cut into it and it was well done. I never send food back, but I did on this occasion because it was a 3:15pm dinner reservation and there is no excuse to overcook steaks when it's not super busy. After sending it back, I was brought a steak that they just threw on the grill for a couple minutes on high heat and they called it a day. It was absolutely rare in the middle and burnt outside. Worst cooked steak ever. I ate it cause it was $74 but the whole deal was terrible. They were out of the desert we wanted at 4:30pm. They said it was cause of the banquet that they had. Ok lol. This place just sucked these days. If you're gonna spend money like that. Go somewhere else for sure. The view is nice of course. But you could find a way better restaurant."

Hostess staff great and the meal went downhill from there. Appetizer felt like QFC sushi cheap. Steak was overdone we sent back and my wifes sat there for 15 minutes - they brought another 22 minutes later after she had finished very poor serving should have taken hers to stay warm. Then forgot shared salad. When I went to the bathroom I asked to talk to the manager and they point out a bald guy named Paul who said oh he was really sorry. He then offered to buy us a drink, which we were charged for. So as we were leaving we asked to see him again to tell him. I saw him in the hallway behind the bathroom and they said nope he is not here. He was laughing with his girlfriend or hitting on a cocktail waitress. Only reason it gets 2 is the view and the hostess. Awful service and good food but very overpriced."

The food was ok, but the service definitely needs improvement.

I don't mean to be one of those vindictive type of yelp reviewers, but certainly this place could use a bit of improvement. On the plus side, the Palisades Ocean Tower was delicious and the cabarnet short rib was delicious."

The restaurant was busy, but we were seated in an uncomfortably tight spot, which already made us feel unwelcome. From there, things only got worse.Despite waiting for 30 minutes, not a single server came to take our order or even offer us water. Meanwhile, we watched other customers, who arrived after us, being served promptly. The servers took their orders, brought out appetizers, and attended to them, but no one bothered to check on us.What made it even more frustrating was that the staff clearly saw us waiting--they even glanced in our direction several times--but chose to ignore us completely. It felt disrespectful and left us wondering why we were being treated this way.After waiting and hoping for someone to acknowledge us, we finally gave up and left. It was humiliating and upsetting to experience such poor service, especially when we had been excited to try a new restaurant.This was the first time something like this had ever happened to us at a restaurant, and it will certainly be the last time we visit Tanoor. If this is how they treat customers, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."

We decided to go on a Friday to avoid the dinner rush. It wasn't very busy, but we ended up waiting for service for 30 minutes. Nobody offered us water and we noticed other people being served. Eventually, we just decided to leave and went to a place across the street. Nobody said anything to us as we left; they seemed more interested in their own conversations.

House made pita... wow! With a large variety of dips- we had the muhammara - peppers,walnuts, pomegranate syrup with a touch of spiciness- could have made a meal from that and the pita! The mixed plate for 2-3 easily served 5 people- freshly grilled veggies, 3 quality meats cooked just right, yellow ( saffron?) rice.  Great value for the quantity of food!    No alcoholic drinks, but a wide variety of juices, teas, and Turkish coffee. Will definitely become a repeat customer!Dietary restrictions: Good variety of keto and vegetarian options.Wheelchair accessibility: I have limited mobility, so I appreciated the no barrier entry- they let me come in a different door,closer to where I parked.

I've worked in restaurants for years and know what good service is. after we were sat the waiter promptly took our drink orders before we could even take a look at the menu. interesting fact, the steaks here a way overpriced. i order the filet, and obviously at these prices i was expecting perfection. instead i got inspection, the steak appeared to be raw so i kindly notified the waiter that i would appreciate a few more min on the grill. when they brought it back to me 10 min later, it was medium well, i ordered medium rare. not to mention the sear on the steak was pathetic. I've been cooking all my life and I could have done better with a filet purchased from Wal-Mart! i was too upset to complain about my meal so i just bit the bullet of a steak and tried to enjoy the remainder of the evening. the service was good but i felt a bit of animosity from the waiter. not sure if ill be coming back here, It' s hard to recommend. el gaucho on the other hand...that's a different story.Ian W."

Two times with groups of about 10 and once with a date. The group things seem to put the staff in a bad way. One time we had extra drinks on our bill (The drinks we ordered from the bar due to not wanting to keep waiting forever for our waiter to take our order were paid for at the bar AND put on our receipt) including a bottle of wine we didn't order, a pile of plates were dropped, we literally did not get asked what choice of side we wanted until one of the people in our party asked the waiter if they wanted to know what we wanted, my steak (medium well) also was literally charred on both sides that the meat on the inside was only about 1/4 inch thick. I get that bigger groups are more difficult and things like dropping plates is just something that is going to happen but if you can't provide excellent service at this price point you need to stay within your abilities.

We visited for a New Year's Eve dinner and everything was going well--until just before midnight. Two minutes before the countdown, we received our dessert and asked if we could step outside to watch the fireworks. The staff asked us to leave our card as a precaution due to previous walkouts, which we did. However, when the fireworks ended, we found the doors locked and struggled to get back inside. To make matters worse, the waitress had already packed up our desserts and removed my glass of wine. This was not how I wanted to start the new year! The manager eventually offered to have our desserts remade at the table, but by that point, the damage was done. The experience left us all with a bitter taste. As leaving I went to the toilet, there was no toilet paper and looked trashed...very unusual.It's truly disappointing to have such an unfortunate experience at Daniel's, especially on a special occasion like New Year's Eve,"

My companion opted for the classic turkey, while I leaned towards the prime rib. The gustatory experience was undeniably praiseworthy, with flavors that underscored a notable culinary finesse.Service, operating within the parameters of adequacy, maintained an understated demeanor, providing a seamless backdrop to our dining experience.However, the post-dinner endeavor to secure leftovers took an unforeseen turn. A meticulous separation of meat and fat, coupled with a modest request for an extra serving of potatoes, aimed to prolong the culinary pleasure. Regrettably, upon revisiting the remains, the gastronomic continuity suffered a setback. The boxed ensemble, lacking cranberry sauce, horseradish that had been left on my plate, and the absent side of coveted potatoes I requested, presented a major Thanksgiving leftovers letdown---especially taking into consideration the high price we had paid for the meal. Nevertheless, let this culinary service anomaly not overshadow the overall commendable nature of the experience. As we contemplate future visits, a pragmatic approach emerges - a proactive request during the boxing process to ensure a more faithful representation of the intended leftovers. Here's to culinary precision and anticipating an untarnished encore in subsequent engagements."

I used Banner Banks smartphone app (official Banner Bank App promoted by bank) to make a deposit as I was leaving for vacation. I had used this process a couple of times before with no problem. This was used to move money from one of my bank account to another (available funds was never stated as a problem). The app involves submitting a photo of both the front and back of the check. When submitting the deposit the app show ""submitted"" as status. After reviewing, the app status gets changed to ""accepted"". I verified that the status was ""Accepted"" before leaving data coverage. When I returned on 7/19/2014, the status still showed ""accepted"" but the transaction was never processed. This resulted in overdraft fees of $120 plus the fees applied by the other banks that were declined. On 7/21/2014 I went to the branch to see what had happened. They said that they had questions about the check and had declined to process it. The teller told me that she didn't care what the app said, it didn't process and they weren't going to back off any charges. When I asked to speak to the manager I was asked to be seated. then a couple of minutes later the teller came back out and said that the manager ""reviewed the case"" and that they wouldn't make any changes. When asked if I could talk to her, I was told NO. When I returned home, I contacted the corporate office and was told it was up to the local branch manager.

If there was a closer place to be I would go there. I may not come back here no matter how much I like them because it is getting frustrating. try at your own risk and don't be scared to return the product!!!
Piroshky Piroshky,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/piroshky-piroshky-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Tammy C.,2,10/25/2013,12,WA,i dont know if I really like this place as much as everyone else. It jsut seems so over breaded. All the food is unnecessarily unhealthy. Maybe it is me because everyone else seems to love it so much. The place came so highly recommended that I am probably a little crazy for not liking it. The pumpkin cinnamon roll was about the only redeeming factor. It was amazingly good but it was burried under a bunch of disappointment.

Situated in a touristy area, the prices were on the higher side, which is expected given the location. The food itself was just okay; while the Classic Smoked Salmon had a decent flavor, it didn't quite stand out as exceptional. The BBQ Pork was similarly average. Overall, it's a convenient spot for a quick bite, especially if you're already in the area, but the taste and value didn't quite match the hype for me."

Their food is pretty good... ask them for their most famous piroshky and you'll be happy. You can't actually sit down and eat so you're going to be dealing with a hit and run scenario. To me, a 5-star rating consists of AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE, AMAZING FOOD, AND AMAZING AMBIANCE and here you just get good food."

This small, bustling bakery offers an incredible selection of hand-held pastries that are as delicious as they are iconic.I tried the Smoked Salmon Pate Piroshky, and it was everything I hoped for and more. The pastry itself was flaky, golden, and baked to perfection, while the filling was rich, flavorful, and packed with high-quality smoked salmon. The balance of buttery dough and savory filling made every bite unforgettable.Be prepared for a line--it's a testament to how beloved this spot is. But trust me, the wait is worth it. The staff works quickly and efficiently, and the pastries are always fresh out of the oven.Whether you're grabbing a quick bite while exploring Pike Place or looking for a unique Seattle treat to take home, Piroshky Piroshky delivers an authentic and satisfying experience."

Piroshky Piroshky,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/piroshky-piroshky-seattle?not_recommended_start=110,Jack B.,4,3/23/2024,13,NY,"Another MUST visit when visiting Pike Place Market! They almost always have a line down the block. Just like Starbucks.  Do not fear the wait times though for Piroshky!!! The lines go very quickly and all food is made from scratch and very fresh!!!4/5 s for atmosphere because it is neat they have windows where you can see into the kitchen and watch them make everything and bake , but they do not have tables or chairs available!!We tried a savory and sweet piroshky! The savory was the salmon pate, which I felt was very fitting since we were visiting the fish market . It was smoked salmon and very creamy--absolutely delicious. The sweet was the Moscow roll. Another delicious choice 4/5 s for service. It is counter service and very quick paced. Not much time for friendly conversation, definitely not rude or bad, just too quick for much.A must try when you are visiting Pike Place Market and I rate it as a must try when in Seattle Peep the food pics there are yummy sights to see!"

Worth one visit, or if you have a favorite pastry here then it's worth a stop if you're in the area, but that's kind of it. I don't understand the super long lines and I definitely wouldn't stand in the cold for it. Sounds harsh, but this place gets so much hype and yes it's good, but the hype doesn't match the product in my opinion. Again, worth one visit, but not my favorite.My only favorite thing to get here is the pastry with the spicy cheese sausage in it. If anything, it speaks volumes on how good the sausage is, not the actual breading around it. It's the only thing I will buy here moving forward. Otherwise, workers here are very friendly and patient, they provide a very comfortable vibe and they are just so nice."

These piroshkies are a little different then what you would find in a typical Russian or Eastern European bakery. The dough is puff pastry instead of baked/fried bread. Reminds me of a fancy empanada or handpie. I had the beef and onion. Based on appearances, I was expecting it to sit like a brick in my stomach but the pastry was surprisingly light with a good beef flavor and nicely seasoned not overly salty. Wish I had more time and the stomach space to sample their other offerings."

This was actually my friends and I's FIRST stop in Seattle. We were hungry and we looked at my Seattle ""to do"" list and bam, there it was. Right in front of our eyes. We waited in the line outside with our luggage because we came straight from the airport. The line did go pretty quickly. Do you know what a piroshky is? If not, compare it to a pierogi or a kolachi. Basically bread with stuff .. stuffed inside lol. Carb heaven I must say. Everything has bread with it. Therefore, if you cannot eat carbs or it's a weakness for you, stay away lol. I ended up getting the Smoked Salmon Pate. Giving the traditional Piroshky a local spin, this bestseller is a delicious blend of Smoked Salmon, cream cheese, a dash of dill and onion. I really loved it. It was nice and warm and the smoked salmon was flavorful.Then during a food tour, I had the Smoked Salmon Pate and then an Apple Cinnamon Roll. This includes slices of Granny Smith Apples dusted with Cinnamon, rolled into dough and finished with a glaze of honey and lemon. It is their bestselling sweet creation. It was really good.The morning we had to run to the airport, we ended up coming back. I had the Spinach, Egg, and Cheese. It contained Spinach tossed with Parmesan then baked with egg. This squared pied is topped of a sprinkle of Columbia Valley Sharp Cheddar. Overall, it was a great experience. A little of the expensive side for a pastry. However, it's a ""must go"" for Seattle!

Piroshky Piroshky,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/piroshky-piroshky-seattle?not_recommended_start=170,Leslie C.,4,01/01/2017,7,WA,"The Piroshky Piroshky location on Cherry and 4th is excellent, with lots of savory and sweet options, including breakfast sandwich style items so this location would get 5 stars. But the location at Pike Place Market focuses on the sweet items and a preference for cinnamon, which are still very tasty, but having more options would be preferred."

They're all pretty good, but my go-to is the beef and cheese. A close runner up is the potato and onion. The sweet ones are really good too. The bread is so flaky and warm. If you're ever in Pike Place Market, I would definitely recommend you check them out. The line can get long, but it's worth it. Best to go during the week."

Piroshky Piroshky,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/piroshky-piroshky-seattle?not_recommended_start=180,Amy M.,4,06/07/2016,7,WA,This place is a great spot downtown for some authentic russian food. I got a piroshky for the first time and it was delicious. I got the turkey and cheddar one and I would definitely recommend. It's always fun to try some food from different countries when you are just in downtown Seattle!
Piroshky Piroshky,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/piroshky-piroshky-seattle?not_recommended_start=180,Nicholas T.,4,06/01/2016,5,WA,I once dated a Russian / Armenian girl whos grandmother introduced me to the Piroshky (what a fun word by the way!)So after finding other spots through yelp I decided to give this one a go and look this place up... pretty glad that I did. Was not dissapointed one bit. I had never though salmon would go well in a piroshky but oh boy was I impressed. I want to go back and try them all. All the food is made fresh daily and it showsYou can taste the freshness in all of the food. I would consider this comfort food and again not sure if it is really healthy although my ex's g-ma used to say it was... Or maybe she wanted me to put those extra pounds on haha
Piroshky Piroshky,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/piroshky-piroshky-seattle?not_recommended_start=180,Ash V.,4,06/01/2016,22,WA,great piroshkys!! great location awesome staff
Piroshky Piroshky,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/piroshky-piroshky-seattle?not_recommended_start=190,Gina M.,4,05/11/2016,267,OH,"One of my favorite places to visit at Pike Place Market! They offer both sweet and savory options, but I tried savory options both times. Their signature item is a smoked salmon pate piroshky... I had someone explain it to me as a somewhat healthy Hot Pocket, and it is very similar! I thoroughly enjoyed the dill flavor in the crust, and the smoked salmon on the inside was fresh, it felt like it had just come out of the oven! I also tried the smoked mozzerella, mushroom, and broccoli and that tasted more like a calzone to me, but still equally as great! The only downside is that this seems to be one of the most popular places in the market and there is often a long line. Be prepared to wait about 15 minutes. It is worth the wait though, I can't wait to come back and try more of their flavors!"

I literally have nothing bad to say relating to this area; the piroshky is consistently fresh and the staff is consistently friendly. I have not attempted all of the many distinct flavors of piroshky, but the ones I 've had (which contain the steak and cheese, rhubarb, cinnamon and cardomon braid, cranberry apple, and basic steak) are amazing! They do not constantly have borscht, but when they do it's also excellent and I highly recommend it."

Piroshky Piroshky,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/piroshky-piroshky-seattle?not_recommended_start=190,Ewa H.,4,4/26/2016,7,WA,"Based on Piroshky Piroshky's web site, Piroshky is a derivative of the Russian word (pir) for banquet. This small hole in the wall definitely lives up to the concept of a double banquet! Situated on exactly the same side of the road as the first Starbucks across from Pike's Place Market, Piroshky Piroshky serves up pastries filled with either salty or sweet ingredients. My favorites include the Apple Cinnamon Roll as well as the Cheese Onion Garlic Roll. They're REALLY SO great!!!"

They have legs from here to forever. That and the baked goods will drive a simple man insane. The Pumpkin Cinnamon Roll was to die for and the smoked salmon was exceptionally fresh. They must have connection with the mob or something to make sure they have first choice at the freshest ingredients. At times it was unbelievable except for the beef and cheese piroshky. You might like beef and cheese more than I do but I guess I grew up with a bit of Jew in me because I don't like how those ingredients mix.

The first time I had it was at the Bumbershoot festival last year. It was freshly made, and the guy gave it to me right out of the fryer. I had the salmon piroshky, shaped like a fish (uber cute). It was sooo good, I went back for another one. Some time later, I was craving another one, so I went by the shop in Pike's Market. It just wasn't the same. sad face. It was still good, but just didn't taste as fresh? I got the same salmon one, but the fish seemed a bit dried out and wasn't as creamy as the one i had at the festival.

From the moment you step inside, the enticing aroma of freshly baked goods surrounds you and the welcoming staff who are super friendly. Among the many delicious options, the smoked salmon pate stands out as an absolute must-try.The smoked salmon pate is incredibly flavorful and perfectly balanced.

This charming bakery is known for its diverse and flavorful piroshkies, and it certainly lives up to its reputation.My personal favorite was the cheese and meat piroshky - a warm, hearty parcel filled with aromatic spices. It was the perfect way to kick-start our day of exploration. The taste still lingers in my memory, making me crave another bite.Another standout item was the Vatrushka, a house specialty. This delectable treat consists of house-made dough topped with marionberries & sweet cream cheese, all dusted with powdered sugar. It was sweet without being cloying, and the marionberries added a delightful tanginess that played off the creamy cheese perfectly.Don't let the line intimidate you - Piroshky Piroshky is more than worth the wait. In fact, the anticipation only adds to the experience. As I pen this review, I find myself longing to be back there again, savoring those incredible flavors.Piroshky Piroshky offers an authentic, delicious taste of Seattle that you won't want to miss.

The bread not only smells good but tastes amazing! The light crispness and softness of the bread just filled me with joy when taking that first bite. From the freshness to the flavor, I felt I was in heaven. Living in California we definitely have good bakeries but this place is definitely unique to the flavor. So wishing there was one here!"

These things are amazing and there are so many options. I will count down the clock with my work mates to run down and grab one and sit and chat with while grubbing. I love the beef and cheese. I'm a creature of habit so I always get the same one. The line can be long high season , but I tend to take an earlier lunch since I work at 530am. These are perfect. Shh. Don't tell!"

If I'm looking for something savory, I always grab the Smoked Salmon Pate Piroshky but if I have a sweet tooth that day, the Moscow Roll hits the spot. The location is nice as I can grab a pastry then stroll the stalls at Pike Place Market."

Piroshky, Piorshky, you are a delightful, savory, devil that will haunt my food dreams. I stuck to the savory items, and although I can't recall the actual name, my favorite was one that had about a bazillion diced up mushrooms in it. I had two, although I wish I had, had the balls to order 4 and let the world judge me how they saw fit. There were some sweet options as well--- one looked like a death star, I abstained given my preference to gorge myself on savory, but it looked great. Also, a fun line to wait in. Part of the experience right?!"

We tried the potato and mushroom, and a chocolate and hazelnut piroshky. Both were delicious, but the potato and mushroom one was particularly flavorful and tasty. The atmosphere was good too.

This is my last day in Seattle and work is carrying me off again. I wanted to leave with a belly full of delicious food and I knew this had to be the place. The crust is perfectly flaky and they are filled to bust. My favorites have to be the beef and onion, the cabbage and onion, and the beef and cheese. The cherry chocolate is always the perfect end. Sometimes the lines are long, *usually* but sometimes if you hit it at the right time, you'll be in and out. Don't let the lines discourage you, it's worth the wait (most good food is). I will certainly miss you and I hope my journey across the country brings me back here again one day."

If you like a YUM piroshky, you must try. If you don't know what a piroshky is, you must try. Try to plan your visit away from popular eating times, as the line outside the place will be long. You won't be disappointed in the place.I didn't know what a piroshky was until I was at a Seafair party 10+ years ago. That's when JEN COLLINS made some for the party and I became a major fan of piroshkies. Jen passed away a few years ago. When I come to PP I think of JEN. This review is dedicated to JEN."

The treats we bought the first day were so great, we came 2 days in a row. First day we lucked out in the afternoon with no line. Next day, we went to get coffee at the first Starbucks in the world next door and got caught up in the morning rush in a 20 minute Piroshky line. My favorite was the salmon pate, a fish shaped pastry filled with tasty salmon pate; it was a first for me, and quite satisfying. I also tried the beef and cheese, ham, cheese, and spinach, smoked mozzarella, mushroom, and broccoli, and apple cinnamon roll, all recommended by other Yelpers, but out of all of them, the salmon pate was in my opinion the most flavorful and suited to my taste. Though the other pastries didn't become my favorite, they were all worth a try. You'll experience various pastry textures and consistencies;"

If you have never had a piroshok (I think they are called?) then you are in for a treat like I was. Basically they are mini pies with ingredients like meat, veggies, and other things inside. They are flakey and crunchy and filled with all sorts of things. My recommendation is the mushroom, chicken, and rice, the flavors mixed so well with the bread. Also the cranberry apple piroshki were a great dessert, although I guess they are technically not a desert.The bottom line is go here, eat, and you will enjoy."

Piroshky Piroshky,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/piroshky-piroshky-seattle?not_recommended_start=880,Rosie B.,5,7/15/2013,15,WA,"Is there anything bad to say about this place (besides the line)? Everytime I go I pick a sweet and a savory one. I know, I know, serious artery blocker. My favorite is still the smoked salmon piroshky. I usually end up at the Market and just follow the smell. Seriously, a classic. Always great."
Piroshky Piroshky,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/piroshky-piroshky-seattle?not_recommended_start=880,Mary S.,5,7/14/2013,4,WA,"Very very busy, but for good reason. The piroshky have amazing crusts, and then filled with flavors such as salmon, broccoli cheese, and cream of mushroom, and sweet Piroshky such as rhubarb and chocolate. There seem to be different types of crust for different types of fillings. I find two savory and one sweet piroshky splits well between 2 people.You will need to stand in line, or go on a slow day (some weekday during the winter when the skies are dark). Then, there is not seating, so you will have to take your piroshky and flee to somewhere more comfortable. If you explore Pike Place, you will find that there is public seating available, or coffee shops you can occupy. If you go straight back and to the left of the Piroshky place, you can find some small amount of public seating, and if that is full, across the street there is a nice park (although someone tried to sell me drugs last time I went there, which might make tourists more uncomfortable).You might wonder if this hassle is worth it. I would say yes. The closest I've found elsewhere is savory pies, but never of the same quality. They are high quality, quirky, but simple, and very Seattle to me. Besides, sometimes standing in line with a bunch of other people excited to experience a place is what you need to convince yourself to pay attention to what you are eating."

Pike's Place itself is an experience, but you never know if tourist spots will have good food. Piroshky's perogies are delish. The line is worth waiting in and moves fast. A perogie is a Russian pie. I had the salmon pate and dill perogie. It was piping hot and flaky, buttery soft. I would order these to have in Texas! For dessert I had an apple cinnamon made with green apples. It was full of big chunks of delicious fresh, apple. It was an affordable lunch for just about $8. Be prepared to eat standing up, unless you can find a bench somewhere around the shops."

The happy hour drinks were incredible, I had mostly lemon drops as they were the special on the wheel and my friend had an smoky old fashioned. We shared a plate of nachoes as well that were incredible. The ambience was loud and fast paced as the place appears to be very popular which is the only downside, it's not quiet or a place to have a conversation."

Vons did not disappoint. I started with the smoked cherry Manhattan and the salmon chowder. The flavor of the salmon chowder was awesome I thoroughly enjoyed it. The bacon chunks caught me by surprise but overall still a great meal. The cherry Manhattan was a bit too sweet for my liking but luckily for me the Monday special was traditional manhattans, so of course I indulged. The traditional manhattan was a crowd favorite and made with love. Highly recommend this place for drinks, ambience, and food. The service was also excellent."

I had high hopes when I ordered a specialty drink from their menu, with a simple request to substitute Bar Boss vodka for Grey Goose. However, the waiter's response left me baffled as he kept mentioning he would ""add on"" to the drink. Confused but willing to trust his expertise, I let it slide.When our drinks finally arrived, I couldn't help but feel like I was sipping on colored water. It seemed like my custom concoction had gone awry. My husband, who ordered his usual Hendricks gin and tonic, was met with a diluted disappointment. We're no strangers to this drink, and this one was exceptionally watered down. In summary, I would advise you to bypass the drinks altogether at this establishment. While the cocktails may leave much to be desired, the food is an entirely different story. We had the ""bang bang chicken"" and a serving of shredded pork fries, both bursting with flavor. If you're dining here, save your money for the delectable dishes and opt for tap beers or bottled drinks if you're in the mood. Skip the bartender's experiments"

They have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating available.Ordered 6 plates of 4 different types of food items: burrata, hummus, bang bang chicken, chicken wings. The food was quite good. Nothing to die for, but good. Chicken wings could have been better. The drinks were fine as well. Some of them have additional presentation added like a mini firecracker (picture attached).Service was fantastic.

The patty was cooked to perfection--juicy, flavorful, and with a slight char that added a smoky depth. The sourdough bun (a signature at Von's) was soft yet sturdy, with a subtle tang that complemented the burger perfectly. The toppings were fresh and well-balanced: crisp lettuce, ripe tomato, melty cheese, and just the right amount of their house-made sauce.I also appreciated the side of hand-cut fries, which were crispy on the outside and fluffy inside--just the way I like them. Paired with one of their craft cocktails, it was an absolutely satisfying meal.The atmosphere added to the experience: casual yet stylish, with great service and a lively vibe. Whether you're a Seattle local or just visiting, Von's 1000 Spirits is a must for a great burger and an unforgettable dining experience."

Luck was on our side -- after a brief wait, we were seated near the back line and welcomed by our server, Chris R.The restaurant was bustling, but it was clear that this place operates like a well-oiled machine. The energy was lively, and the efficiency of the staff was remarkable.Chris greeted us promptly with a warm smile and immediately made us feel at ease. He expertly guided us through the menu, offering thoughtful recommendations that showcased the restaurant's best dishes in a way that was both helpful and approachable.We ordered: * Sparkling Water * Brain Booster Mocktail * Hefeweizen Beer * Bang Bang Chicken (a playful nod to where we first met -- a place called Bang Bang) * Alfredo Chicken Sourdough Pasta * Roasted Mushroom Sourdough Pizza (served with hot honey on the side, per Chris's suggestion -- a brilliant recommendation)Every single item was incredible. The flavors were balanced, the quality was superb, and each dish left us wanting just one more bite.From start to finish, the service was top-notch. We even noticed a busser nearby who cleaned a four-top table with such impressive speed and precision, it seemed almost superhuman.Thank you, Chris, and the entire Vons 1000 Spirits team for a refreshing, memorable, and delicious dining experience.We will definitely be back! :)"

The ambiance is vibrant, the service was top-notch, and the food hit all the right notes.

The burger was a standout too, with the soft, melt-in-your-mouth bread elevating the whole experience.As for drinks, the selection is insane--literally thousands of options! I think the bartender mentioned they have over 2,000 bottles behind the bar. I went with the pineapple old-fashioned, and it was perfectly crafted and absolutely hit the spot. Great food, great drinks, great vibes--definitely a must-visit!"

Our server was on the ball and answered all our questions. I went for the steak and garlic cheese fries. The steak was on point, but the fries were a bit too greasy for my liking--I couldn't finish them.I'm glad I made reservations, even for a late dinner midweek, because this place fills up super fast. I definitely want to come back and try more items from their menu. Though there weren't a ton of choices, but based on what I had, I'd say all their veg options are top-notch.Skip driving and just grab a cab. Parking around Pike Place is always a nightmare."

The Original Mac & 4 Cheeses is a standout dish, featuring sourdough pasta made in-house, a creamy and amazing cheese sauce, and perfectly complementary breadcrumbs on top--definitely a must-try. The Quatre Viande Pizza boasts an excellent dough with a crunchy yet soft crust and savory toppings balanced by a subtly sweet tomato sauce. The Hass Avocado & Billionaire's Bacon burger is another winner, with juicy beef, flavorful bacon, and avocado that ties everything together perfectly. The Seattle Seafood Stew has a comforting tomato flavor, with flakey cod, well-cooked clams, and fluffy focaccia for dipping, though the stew's overall flavor is somewhat muted. For dessert, the Vanilla Ice Cream, served with a huge sparkler for my birthday, was fresh with a noticeable vanilla bean taste, though a bit icy in texture which I personally enjoyed.The interior is dimly lit and cozy, creating a warm atmosphere. It gets packed around dinnertime, which is a good sign because it means the food is good! The service was generally good despite the busy environment; the wait time was shorter than expected, and the staff was friendly and helpful, even if the waitress couldn't check in as often as desired.

Wish I tried their original location. Most of their dishes were too salty. My favorite was the nasi lemak, had the right texture, balance in flavor, and nice plating. Would skip the pineapple and cucumber salad, mine had mainly pineapple and just tastes like tajin and fish sauce, can simple make at home. The fried chicken wings were dry and simple, would pass on that as well. Food portions were small for the price.Staff were friendly, checked up on us often and gave good recommendations.

Wonderful service by Chris who made sure we were comfortable throughout the meal. I had the Walla Walla burger that was delicious, but the pasta is absolutely to die for! We will be visiting here again soon!"

I mean, I've seen some impressive bartenders in my time, but these two take the cake (or should I say, the cocktail)!First off, let's talk about the happy hour - it was like a magical potion of joy and discounted drinks. I don't know how they do it, but Taylor and Erick managed to turn an ordinary evening into a fabulous fiesta! And the drinks? Oh boy, they were so tasty that I almost wanted to order one of each just to taste the rainbow of flavors. I'm pretty sure they secretly sprinkle a little bit of unicorn dust in every glass.Now, let's not forget the atmosphere - it was as lively as a pack of party animals on a Friday night! I don't know if it was Taylor and Erick's magnetic personalities or just the fact that they make drinks that are pure liquid happiness, but the place was buzzing with good vibes.Overall, my experience with Taylor and Erick at Vons 1000 Spirits was nothing short of amazing. They're like the Batman and Robin of bartending - except instead of fighting crime, they're fighting sobriety! If you want a good time, tasty drinks, and an atmosphere that feels like a non-stop party, look no further than these two maestros of mixology. Cheers to Taylor and Erick - you both were absolutely fabulous!!"

I came in just after checking into the hotel around lunch time and was surprised to find a full and bustling bar with the coolest kitchen and tons of cool stuff to look at everywhere! Josh, the host was warm and welcoming handed me menus and pointed me to the bar upon request. I was greeted with a warm friendly smile by Jess the bartender and a personal pitcher of nice cold water without first requesting. I was excited after reading the menu and asked Jess for some recommendations on a house cocktail and some lunch options. She suggested the old fashioned alternative they called ""The Leatherbound,"" and after a lovely rundown of the menu I decided on the Tellicherry Chicken pasta dish, which came out in superhero time. I was blown away with BOTH my drink and my pasta dish. Sabrina, the other bartender, came over to check on me just after my food was delivered- there was absolutely nothing that could have made my lunch any closer to perfection. The atmosphere was rocking throughout the restaurant, everyone was smiling and the service was incredible! I unfortunately had to go off to a work meeting for the rest of the day followed by an early flight home in the morning so I couldn't experience more cocktails and what looks to be a fantastic menu. The only bad part was leaving this little treasure I had just discovered. Thank you for a wonderful, even if brief, experience. I wish there were more establishments just like this one!"

As soon as I walked in the door, I was greated by a lovely young host. I think her name was Zia? She took the time to find accommodations for my group. There were 6 of us on a busy Friday night, yet she was able to find us a table almost immediately, to our delight. Our server, Elizabeth, was a wealth of knowledge on their spirit collection ( Yes they really have over 1 thousand) and was able to recommend each of us great drinks to try. Having already been impressed, to food left me speechless. Their ""Mac n 4 cheeses"" was decadent. The perfect amount of rich, not to mention how delicious their house made sourdough pasta is! My wife had Avocado Bacon burger and was equally satisfied. It safe to say me and my family will be back soon!"

Their sourdough pesto pasta was delicious! What I really appreciated was that our server, Traci, took the time to explain all her favorite key dishes to us when we were having difficulty deciding over the incredible menu choices.What really stood out to me as a patron was the care she took with our kids at the table. My daughter loves mac and cheese but there was no option for it on the kids menu. Without hesitation Traci said she could modify a kids pasta to make as mac and cheese. She did give warning that the mac and cheese would be a bit spicy but my daughter was elated at the idea of mac and cheese. Wouldn't you know it, as children do, my daughter changed her mind after one bite. Apologetically I explained the situation to our server when she came to the table after the food was delivered. Traci was more than happy to replace my child's meal with an alternative cream sauce, which my daughter loved, and the new dish was out within minutes of my request. As a parent it is always an adventure to go out with your children because you can never anticipate how long their attention will be kept before they are ALL DONE and want to move on. I was extremely impressed and thankful for the care and understanding our server took to make sure everyone at my table enjoyed their meal. Even though Von's has 1000 spirits and seems to cater to an older crowd I still left feeling it was a family-friendly restaurant as well."

Our table had the following: pulled pork Mac and cheese (2 orders), pulled pork fries, salmon pasta, salmon chowder, salmon fish and chips (3 orders), and hamburger. The entire party would come back.

The atmosphere was incredible- unique and classy yet edgy, fun and chaotic without being boisterous, a mystery without being complicated. The staff (ask for Gabby!!) was beyond helpful as well as knowledgable, attentive without being annoying; impeccable service. The manager was out and about, the entire place was so genuine it was almost hard to believe. I would give more stars if I could, AMAZING experience.

I love the decor, the lighting, the food, the drinks..........AND, dun da da DAAAAAhhhhh, the beignet's are little cushions of happy. I was out and about doing some photography when started to get a little hungry, plus it was beer-thirty. The glowing sign peeked out and caught my attention. I went in to order a stout and the cinnamon sugar beignets and from that moment I was hooked. I knew, just from the menu, there was more deliciousness to come. I wasn't wrong.  They have an aged old eloquent selection of liquors on a lovely glass shelf with little cards that indicate what it is and pricing, plus a full bar, and nice beer on tap. They have really good cocktails and it's always fun to spin the wheel and see what you can get a discount on for the next thirty minutes. The staff is really nice and accommodating and I just have the best time when I go in there. The burgers are unique and good, the pizza is amazing, the pasta is delicious, and the salmon soup/stew with a nice chunk of sourdough soaking in the bowl is heavenly. I've ordered that twice. It's just great and I'm running out of adjectives to describe it. Just go in, sit down, and enjoy yourself."

Although, this week I attempted the Monster. Clearly, I was not going to finish this behemoth version of a double-double in five minutes, but was worth a try.

When we got our food it was cold. They were greasy, soggy, and the lettuce didn't even look like it was edible. We also ordered fries, hibiscus tea, and churros. Not a single thing was edible. It was incredibly expensive for the items we good which again were not edible. We are physically ill and would never ever eat her again. I even tried putting the inside contents on the sandwich on toasted sourdough bread (since the bread was soggy). The sandwich was still horrible and gross. I'll probably be in the bathroom the rest of the night. Thanks Paseo!"

Ryan Santwire (the owner) is a prime example of an exploitive culture vulture who profits off of a stolen brand and cuisine. The food doesn't compare to the original, especially the caramelized onions, which are bland.

Its tough, not tender. No matter how much mayo you slather on that sandwich, you can't hide the truth. Braising pork takes time, I know you have to make a lot of it, but what is the point if you are just going to half ass it. Not to mention, nobody in that joint looks happy to be there. Whats up y'all, not paying your people enough? Hiring people who will accept your crappy wages and work environment over people who should get paid more and will make better food.

The Paseo magic left with the original owners. Sure it is the same name, but, usually when a restaurant is purchased the previous owners teach the new owner's the recipes and techniques. This is obviously NOT the case. The new owner poached the place in the hallway of a courthouse auction. The food tastes like a Bellevue version of Cuban food - bland, dry, and lacks originality. We will miss you original Paseo. Yes, it was #2 with the previous owners. Definitely not number two under this ownership that purchased it in a hallway auction WITHOUT the recipes. Pathetic."

I've eaten here about 25 times already, and the sandwiches are always fucking BOMB!!! But I must say, service has gone downhill. Wait times have increased from 15 minutes (About 2 years ago) to now 30-60 minutes. The workers are slow as fuck. They look stoned to hell (Hey I use to smoke and work at fast food too) and are slow to take your order and don't really give a shit about you. The napkins and hand sanitizer wipes were empty when I was there recently, and I told them about it and it took them 15 minutes to refill them. It's like the owners of Paseos knows everybody loves their food, they're bringing in hoards of cash with their low overhang and endless stream of customers, so FUCK CUSTOMER SERVICE cause these PASEO ADDICTED FIENDS will ALWAYS come back for more.I also have a conspiracy theory on how they create artificial drug like demand. After 5pm, they usually run out of fucking bread. Tell me, how fucking hard is it to get BREAD!?!?! It's fucking bread. It's not some magic Cuban bread that falls out the sky when the Earth's hemispheres hits a certain longitude. How hard is it to send some 19 year old pothead to GO GET MORE FUCKING BREAD!?!? It's like they run out of bread purposely, so you get PISSED and return the next day ready to double your order to make up for yesterday's waste of time. And they know your succulent pork morsel addicted crackfiend ass will be BACK the NEXT DAY ready to order again.I'm starting to wonder if Paseos is owned by a Cuban druglord and his business is simply a front to launder cash....o.O*Disclosure* I went to Paseos today and they ran out of fucking bread.

If you just drove by and didn't know what it was, you'd think it's a food bank, seeing how many hungry-looking folks standing in line.Anyways, my curiosity got the best of me and I got in the long line and waited for 40 minutes, paid $9 for the Caribbean Roast sandwich and waited for another 20 minutes for my order to be ready. For a finger food joint, it's hideous, yo!!And it was a disappointing experience. To be fair, the pork was very good with a hint of soy sauce used in its aioli marinade. The caramelized onion gave good flavor and a nice texture to the combination while the lettuce provided an overall freshness. The bread was baked to near perfection. But the sandwich looked obnoxious. Because it's made from a stupid recipe. The hard bread a la French baguette isn't meant to be made into a sandwich, let alone with heavy fillings. That's why it's so messy to eat. The Vietnamese Banh mi, on the other hand, is made from a modified French baguette with rice flour added to the dough, and the bread and the fillings are rather light.   The Paseo sandwich is neither traditional nor authentic. It should be called the random sandwich instead, because no one can trace its origin to the Caribbean, Cuba or even Miami. There's nothing Caribbean or Cuban about the sandwiches at Paseo. For all I care, it can be called the Nigerian sandwich or whatever. It's a faux ethnic food item, just like the infamous fortune cookies. For some strange reasons, the joint has become quite popular here in North Seattle. But I'm not a masochist and I don't like waiting for an hour for a kid-sized meal, where ever the hell it came from.

Too bad that sandwich no longer exist there anymore. I had eaten there four times a week for the last five years of my life, and I didn't recognize one face working the counter or the back kitchen. I wonder what returning employees they are always boasting about. If there was a returning employee, it wasn't someone high up in the back kitchen. Now back to the sandwich, the meat as others have posted was dry dry dry. It tasted like it was made three days ago and re-heated that morning in a watery broth. The sauce was less spicy and the bread was still pretty rock hard as usual. This all equates to someone who isn't Cuban and trying a feeble attempt at re-creating it. Yes, it looked the same with the big juicy onions but it lacked the execution, experience, and most important the love for the product. This an Americanized version of the previous sandwich. But, I feel this restaurant is not as good or the same as when owned by the previous family. I don't predict longs lines after their initial push when they opened.Also the guy working the cash register wearing the stocking hat is truly horrible. The look he gives you is sort of condescending, like I'm lucky to eat there. I guess it is probably all the tourist that don't know any better, or all the Seattlelites that only ate here once a year and can't really remember what the original version tasted like. I won't be going again for an overpriced sandwich at $12 dollars for not even half as good as it was before."

I'd been there a long time ago, so I thought I knew what to expect, but still. It was a rare hot day in Seattle, so I decided to hang out in Fremont for the afternoon. The line at Paseo was extremely long, as usual. I waited in the hot sun for about 30 minutes before getting under the shaded awning of the restaurant. The line started moving, and as I made my way to the front, I saw the dreaded sign: Cash Only. I cursed myself for forgetting they were cash sticklers, and that I was out of cash. By this point I was at the front of the line anyway. I mentioned it to the guy taking orders, and he said that he could take my order, and that I could run up the block and get cash from an ATM and come back. Not ideal, but I agreed. I ordered a scallop sandwich, then took a walk to the grocery store up the block to get cash. Twenty minutes and a $3 ATM fee later, I was back. I gingerly made my way to the front of the line again, explaining to the people who I was passing that, no, I wasn't cutting in line and taking the spot that they had waited a half an hour to claim, and that I was simply picking up an order. I paid my $10 (including tax) for my prize, handed to me rather unceremoniously in a warm plastic bag. (Side note: Aren't they banned now?) I briefly considered waiting for one of the three tables in the restaurant to clear out, but that wasn't happening. Instead, I took my sandwich down Fremont Ave., looking for any spot to stop and eat it. No park benches or appealing curbs, so my choices were a bus shelter or a dirt-covered ledge in a public park. I chose the ledge, and there, yes, I finally savored the sweet taste of victory. I sunk my teeth into the sandwich, and it was as delicious as I remembered it. For a brief second, it was all worth it. But then, the sandwich basically disintegrated on me, and on the dirty ledge where I was eating. Caramelized onions, cilantro, the garlic tapenade... they all schlooped down my hands and onto the ground. The whole thing was over in under five minutes. And there I was, stooping in a wooded park, my face and hands covered in some weird Caribbean sauce, $13 poorer and a good chunk of my afternoon gone. Honestly, it doesn't seem like a good way to spend one's time. Of the hour and a half I spent procuring, financing, and eating this sandwich, less than 10 minutes of it was pleasant. To me it's just not worth the bullshit. I would be interested in going back if they ever expanded their space, but as it is it's mostly a novelty that's best experienced once."

The stars from the prior restaurant should not carry forward. New ownership=new recipes. The food is alright. The prices are a lot higher than they were. It is just not the same. Reviews should be based on the place since it was acquired.
Paseo,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paseo-seattle-11?not_recommended_start=60,Alicia C.,5,12/25/2013,46,WA,"Sad that the quality seems to have changed with the ownership. Have tried Paseo 3 times since it changed hands and this last was truly THE last. My fish sandwich just was a disappointment. The onions were more raw than not and although ordered with a 2-out-of-5 star spicy it came with more than 24 jalapeño slices. Whoa! (Yes I counted) And it fell apart immediately. I really have loved this place over the years and hope they get back to the basics soon. On a positive note: I love the addition of outside seating, a second register and credit card payment option now. AND the staff has always been very friendly!"

Still a great place to go to for a meal but the food definitely has a different taste to it now then how I remember things from when would stop in with my (aspiring) musician friends. The Caribbean Roast is still my favorite! It has been a classic here and always will be. I just wish it was a little more fluffy like the good old days. Still great food nonetheless and would recommend eating at Paseo to anyone! Very good service and the meats they use are always top-notch-like-butterscotch!

Paseo,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paseo-seattle-11?not_recommended_start=90,Whitney B.,3,10/28/2013,424,WA,"I have been chasing the opportunity for a Paseo sandwich for close to a decade like a dog in heat and I finally rode the Paseo orgy train this weekend. It felt like I was handed someone else's sloppy seconds fermenting in a dirty loincloth. The unpleasant sight of my eating a Paseo sandwich ranks as one of my relationship milestones among being able to shit in your presence, comfortably talk about vaginal blood clots, and a gesture of endearment equates to nightly dutch ovens. If you are still attracted to your significant other after watching them finger-bang a Paseo Press lubricated by a jug of grease, I would consider that a real avenue of love. If one is going to fetishize a sandwich, at least have the decency to fetishize a sandwich that demonstrates immaculate culinary skills and whose bread isn't a gigantic crouton. Luckily, we came in early enough to avoid all of the other thirsty asses. Had we arrived any later, I think we would have spent at least 30 minutes waiting in line for an under-seasoned, overcooked sandwich. I would rather asphyxiate myself with plastic wrap. Dare I say that the Paseo Press and Caribbean Roast both had overcooked, chewy pork and terrifyingly under-performed in regards to flavor and taste overall. I am stunned at how something can be so freakishly oily and awfully bland at the same time. The only ounce of flavor I tasted was one pickled jalapeño that fell out of my sandwich, as with everything else to the point where it deconstructed itself. Customers ought to file a license in order to be in public with an unconcealed weapon that is the bread of a Paseo sandwich. Shit's terrible as sandwich bread, it's super dense and hard to chew. The pressure you have to apply to gnaw at the bread forces the pork and other insides to fall out. Stupid. I did prefer the Caribbean Roast far more than the Paseo Press because it had the lettuce and mayonnaise, which counteracted the pork jerky. Paseo is running on a fine line between a tolerable sandwich stop and an overrated fartbag. I am going to give Paseo the benefit of the doubt because it might have been an off day for whomever prepared the pork in the back; however, it seems that they are consistent with inconsistencies with either service or the food. I would hardly worship the grounds on which they erect their 10-person capacity shacks."

Messy foods always tend to be quality and good. However, the need to stand in a long line and wait to get this sandwich is lost on me. It's just not a trend I can get into and it really hampers my enjoyment of the establishment and its food."

Less than a minute a person. There had to be about 25 people in front of me, but I waited only 15-20 minutes. I had the pulled pork sandwich. Amazing and large. The beans should have been called bean soup because they were very watery... still flavorful though. I didn't like that the cuban food was served on chinese style plates... I think they can afford better dish ware for the profit they are turning. My biggest problem with them was the long line and small amount of seating. I hope they move to a bigger location soon."

The combination of tender roast beef, tangy Caribbean spices, and fresh vegetables made for a truly unforgettable taste experience.The sandwich itself was generously sized, and the bread was perfectly toasted to add a nice crunch to each bite. But what really stood out was the incredibly juicy and tender meat, which was cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor.Unfortunately, I can't give the same glowing review for the wings I tried. While they were decent, they were just ordinary and didn't quite measure up to the outstanding flavors of the Caribbean roast sandwich.Overall, I highly recommend giving the Caribbean roast sandwich a try if you're in the mood for something truly special. It's a definite 4/5 stars in my book!"

It is a bit pricey at 9.75... but it's worth it! The braised pork is amazingggg!! It melts in your mouth. The onions are really good too.

I despise basic breakfast/brunch foods. Being a home cook, I want something a bit more original and complex that I haven't made at home a million times.The setting is in a perfect location. Fremon t a nice walking yuppie area where everyone pretends to be yoga/pilates experts in their Lulu outfits they may or may not have actually worked out in. It was beautiful weather so I asked to sit out front, but the place is SO light and airy inside that I would have gladly sat in there instead.A couple great bloody marys, some avocado, and perfect size portions and we were done! Would love to explore their regular menu as well. Flavors were simple yet complex enough to be interesting and satisfying.The only drawback of a lunch h is the ""lunch crowd"". The most painfully basic conversations about their cliche night before, drivel about the pointless rest of their day, or people practically making out with random dogs walking by. But, that is to be expected and this restaurant does not hold exclusivity in cheesy people!"

Sure there are some improvements like the fact that they take credit cards. But the food is like 90% the same. There's just something that's not exactly the same. It's a little bit more tangy than before. The flavors from the jalapeños come through a lot more. They also wrap the sandwiches differently. Put together it still makes for a good experience, but it's still not quite the original legend."

We ended up waiting about 45 minutes to order, and another 15-20 to receive our food after that. The line went fast enough, and the cashier at the front was very courteous, unlike what I would expect in a similar situation in New York City.I got the Caribbean Roast sandwich, which is their specialty. I have to say: it is the best sandwich I have had in my life to date. I was hard-pressed to think of a sandwich that was that close, honestly. The famous cheesesteaks of Philadelphia were no match; only a deli sandwich from 2nd Ave Deli in NYC is close, but no cigar.There is so much going on in this sandwich. The pork is sopping with juice and flavor. The aioli adds a pop, and the caramelized onions add some sweetness and complexity. Add some cilantro and romaine for a little bit of balance and a lightly toasted baguette and this thing is damn close to perfect. Keep in mind, though: it is near impossible to eat without making a tremendous mess. Be prepared to be covered in sauce, but you won't mind."

It was very good and craved for another, but at the time I went back a few weeks later, they were closed for a vacation. Yikes! A coworker told me about a sack lunch box lunch whatever delivery company that they had ordered from in the North called Eclectic. I was weary, because who could compete with Seattle's best sandwich? I gave them a call and they said that they would deliver to our company the following day (24 hours notice is required for all orders). Holy $%#! Their Cubano was a taste that lingered in my mouth! It wasn't Paseo's #2 but more along the lines of Paseo's press, (but not pressed) with ham and Swiss, succulent pork and actual caramelized onions! I wish they had a storefront! If you're ever in the mood to have lunch delivered to you or your company (and can call ahead), their Cubano is other-worldly. They have other stuff too, like Chinese humbao and Vietnamese Bah Mi sandwiches, but we all ordered the Cubano and didn't regret a thing!

The one thing that sort of irritated me was how full of themselves the employees were while I was there. I asked them which sandwich they'd really recommend and their standard reply apparently ""dude ALL of our sandwiches are to die for"".

Ask yourself what are you waiting for? I discovered Paseo's when I signed up with yelp last year. It would be the most recommended restaurant for weeks. Like a hit song in the Top 40. I got the pirate to take me to lunch here. So we had the Pork Sandwiches since that was the Only item that did not sell out. We were lucky. They only served 6 people after us. They ran out of bread. The food here flies out like Planes out of Seatac. The sandwiches were memorable. He rarely dishes out $8.00 for something exotic. Being from the backwoods of Michigan he rarely eats anything ethnic. He usually is a cheap skate kind of guy. He really likes the $5 Subway sandwiches. So if I can get the pirate to try something new and he treats, its a win win for both parties. And like Mikey said ""He likes it !!""If your new to the area take a tip from the many locals who review restaurants online. You gotta try this place at least once. Drive, fly, crawl stand in line with the throngs of people and wait patiently. Your time will be well spent."

I'm not sure who coined that word but it probably has something to do with Paseos. Their Midnight Cuban sandwich is to DIE for. Be prepared to bring cash and you might have to wait to get a seat as the actual eating section of the establishment is rather small but for the love of God please do not pass this place up. The food melts in your mouth and their sauces are spectacular. Writing this review made my mouth water. Drop everything and find your way here. It will definitely behoove you to do so.

It's always hard with a restaurant because so many things can affect your perception of the place. I have to say though, as objectively as I can, my meal was good. Real good. I think people get a little crazy with the five stars around here. They start handing them out like bread loaves at a soup kitchen. A five star hotel is a place you stay that makes you want to not go home to your wife and kids. A five star meal is a dinner that makes you want to cut out your tongue afterwards so you don't have to suffer a mediocre meal ever again. This place is a solid four.

It can get pretty busy as this place has now become a Seattle staple, but its always worth the wait. I've been coming to the Fremont location for years now and I'm ecstatic to find out that there's a new location in Capitol Hill now as well.

It was a 2004 1-owner Tacoma TRD with 64,424 miles for less than $16,000 and had good Carfax and Autocheck reports. It also had the following features I was looking for: four wheel drive, automatic transmission, V-6 engine, TRD/SR5 road package, locking rear differential, and 2-door cab.The pickup was first listed online on March 17. We called the salesman, Mr. Curt Ritter, that afternoon and bought the pickup the next morning.  My son (who is a knowledgeable and experienced vehicle buyer) assisted with a preliminary inspection and we took the pickup on an extensive test drive. The vehicle's condition and performance were completely as advertised. A subsequent detailed inspection by an independent mechanic verified that the pickup was in very good condition with no problems. During the entire transaction, Mr. Ritter dealt with us in a friendly, straightforward, and honest manner. I would be glad to purchase another vehicle from McMinnville Toyota at any time in the future."

Even though it's been a few days since I purchased it, I am still amazed at the professionalism and straightforwardness which isn't something your ordinarily associate with car dealerships.I have been researching the car I purchased for over 6 months and I knew the price I wanted to pay. I checked with over 20 Honda dealer who all flatly turned me down. I recently got an email from Nick Cruthers telling me that he could come very close to the price I wanted to pay. I sent his offer to all the other dealers - not one of them said they could even match it, let alone beat it, and a few suggested that Mr. Cruthers wasn't being entirely honest with me.I drove out of South Tacoma Honda having financed the car at exactly what I wanted to pay. They didn't try to force me to pay any other fees, etc. Of course they offered accessories and other stuff, but I refused everything - and they still smiled and treated me like a king.

Mind you, we were so hungry and tired, the walk from our hostel to Paseo was a little longer than we expected, we waited about 20 minutes in the long line to order and about 20-30 minutes more to receive our order, walked BACK to our hostel to eat because there was no seating there, AND IT WAS STILL WORTH IT! SO DELICIOUS! We got the Paseo Press? Their most popular pressed sandwich that takes a little longer to make. It was seriously delicious. The meat, cheese, grilled onion, and whatever sauce they used went PERFECTLY together. Paseo is a MUST TRY when you're visiting Seattle and want to stop by the cute little Fremont area."

The Pacific Rim Automotive is the closest you'll get from a dealer. Unhappy with the demeanor of one of his employees, I had placed a bad review here before. Couple of hours later John gets in touch with me to apologize and gives me great news. He's willing to do my timing belt, replace my water pump, and fix the power window at no cost. It's exactly what we expect from a professional in this type of situation. No regrets to have driven my car to the Pacific Rim Automotive at all. I'm here to testify that they will work hard to get the job nicely done no mater what. I strongly recommend the Pacific Rim Automotive for your Subaru Forester. Ask for John that it can't go wrong.

Before I left Arizona, my tattoo artist made sure to let me know about Paseo. ""Remember Paseo! That is all!"" he said in complete seriousness. So I did.My boyfriend and I got to Fremont around 9:00 a.m.--too early because nothing is open, apparently. We started at Fremont Coffee Co. and walked around a bit, then headed down to the water to find the Troll before Paseo opened at 10:30. We walked all the way up what felt like the tallest hill in the entire world before arriving at tiny Paseo around 10:00. A line was already forming, and we made friends with a gentleman named Terrence who said it was also his first time, and he would be grabbing sandwiches to-go. Everything I've read told me not to take it to-go unless you plan on wearing most of it.I intended to get the full experience. My boyfriend and I both went for the Caribbean Roast Sandwich. It took all of three minutes to get, and we even got a table! We sat, unwrapped the steaming pile of pork and went at it. It was the most satisfying greasy mess I've ever had the pleasure of wearing all over my face and hands. The jalapenos scattered throughout offered the perfect kick to the mild flavor of the pork. The baguette was crisp and stayed that way!I looked around the room and noticed not two people eat a Paseo sandwich the same way. While we opted for the ""face first"" method, one man had grabbed a fork and taken off the top part of the sandwich, scooping sauce and pork in single-bite increments. Another gent had used a fork entirely. Some a bag, already slightly spotted with grease, to-go. It was magical to see everyone so satisfied!It turned out to be a good thing we walked a hundred blocks up a gigantic hill to get to Paseo because we were absolutely full to the brim after. I would walk up that hill a million times over just to get to that sandwich. You have quite the gem, Seattle!!"

When friends come into town to visit, this is a place I try to take them to. And at first, I didn't get it, it was just a sandwich that tasted normal. But the more I have it, the more it sticks out to me. Fair warning for those having it the first time, this is a greasy sandwich so load up on napkins. I usually go for the Cuban Roast, as it's what they tout as their most popular. Comes with HUGE slices of onions, a leaf of lettuce and some juicy savory pork. Can't figure out what the sauce is either, is it just mayo? In any case, the bite goes down so good and the jalapenos add the heat that I look for in any great sandwich. I would consider getting extra jalapenos next time.A tip if you plan on heading there is call in an order beforehand. After about half an hour, you can walk right in and pick it up instead of waiting in line. I've waited for an hour and half before."

OMG I can still remember the sandwichy goodness exploding with every bite. They roasted it and toasted it and it was just lovely the way it worked out. I couldn't get enough it. Each bite was better than the one before. If it were legal I would marry the sandwich.
Paseo,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/paseo-seattle-11?not_recommended_start=780,Borja B.,5,10/23/2013,6,WA,I walked in skeptical and left a believer in the power of meat between bread. It is so difficult to explain the sheer joy one receives from getting a sandwich from a well managed restaurant with fresh ingredients. It was as if I was blind my whole life and then suddenly I saw colors for the first time. I recommend the Italian sandwich sprinkled with basil and lightly toasted for perfection and a well rounded meal. After each bite remember to cleanse your palate after each bite with a crisp spring water. This way each time you chew it is nothing but flavor explosions in your mouth.

I had previewed a brunch menu online that looked like it was on point, but I was really sold by the fact that they take online reservations for brunch - unheard of in Seattle - and all I really wanted was some good food in a decent atmosphere without the hours long wait that generally trademark brunch in this city.While this is certainly one of the many dinner/bar locations that brunch offerings are clearly their second line of business, with ""brunch"" written on a chalkboard for diners to take notice while they are in for a drink on a Friday night, I was pleasantly surprised at the airiness of the place with the roll-up opened on a nice summer day.Service was great - timely, thoughtful, and kind. Mimosas were generous in the champagne department and were mixed with fresh oj. And the food - THE FOOD! I ordered the beef short rib chilaquiles and the hubs ordered the fried chicken/waffle. The chilaquiles were delicious! Topped with radish and cilantro, a side of black brand with cotija cheese, and served with crème fraîche, a lime wedge, and green ""diablo salsa"" - just the right amount of heat. The fried chicken and waffle were also amazing - the chicken was juicy on the inside and had perfectly crispy skin, and the waffle was sprinkled with pecans and bacon and topped with a cardamon butter that was to die for! The perfect sweet/savory brunch item.If you're looking for a fabulous brunch without the wait, re:public is now definitely on the top of my list."

The red letters on the sign make it that much more magical. Anywho, we had a private company event here and I definitely indulged. The ambiance was very romantic so I could definitely see myself cruising here for a nice glass of vino on a weekend or weekday with a sweet lil' thang.I had the crab puffs as an appetizer and they were quite scrumptious, some amazing lasagna and pasta for my entree. After I was almost all the way full I tried their rib eye and was immediately blown away. This place wasn't too pricey so definitely worth your time if you're in the area.Bonus info: This is about 1 notch up from Joey's in SLU. It's more expensive so I would recommend Joey's if you're just having drinks and/or a light appetizer and Re:Public if you want a higher class menu and ambiance."

You just have to get a little wine-drunk first and savor each bite. I wish I had done a review when this was still on the menu, but I am going to mention it anyway...foie gras creme brulee. Yep, most amazing thing I have ever had in my entire life. I couldn't tell if I was eating a meal or a dessert, omg, if you guys are reading this please, please bring it back! I have only sat at the bar, but service is always attentive even when its busy. Until last week I was only in on weekday nights, but I stopped by for a martini by myself on a friday and it was packed! Definitely a fun scene on the weekends if you are looking to meet people or come in with a group, probably not as good for a date seeing as it was super loud, but good for them for being busy. A+"

While the ambiance and drink selection were noteworthy, my overall impression was tainted by uncomfortable seating, lackluster food, and an unpleasant aftermath.Let's start with the positives. The restaurant's ambiance and wine selection create a cozy and sophisticated atmosphere, making it a suitable spot for drinks and socializing. However, when it comes to the dining experience, there are considerable drawbacks.The seating arrangement was notably uncomfortable, detracting from what could have been an enjoyable evening. The chairs lacked ergonomic design, making it difficult to relax and fully savor the dining experience.Turning to the food, I ordered the chicken, expecting a premium dish given the prices. Regrettably, the reality fell short of expectations. The chicken was disappointingly dry, reminiscent of a budget BBQ chicken one might find at a grocery store. The lack of succulence and flavor left me questioning the value for the cost.Unfortunately, my disappointment did not end with the underwhelming meal. The next day, I experienced persistent gas and an upset stomach. While I'm not quick to attribute these symptoms solely to the restaurant, it does raise concerns about the quality of ingredients or food handling practices.In light of my overall dissatisfaction and the subsequent digestive discomfort, I believe the establishment should consider refunding my purchase. A dining experience should leave patrons satisfied and comfortable, and unfortunately, Purple Café and Wine Bar fell short of these expectations."

The last two times I have been there in the last two months, the servers just seemed to be checked out and going through the motions. There is no passion in their work, and they are no longer trying to create an ambiance or a dining experience, and when I drop 2-300 for a dinner for 2, I expect more. I went there this evening, and again the waitress comes over with a nice bottle of wine, but where is the sommelier? Have they gotten rid of this program where the Som comes over and decants your wine. I loved talking about wine with the Som, and thought it added a nice touch. Guess Harvest Vine and Luc will now get my business. Goodbye Purple Cafe. My filet mignon was not medium, and even though I told my server, she didn't really seem to care, and I am not one to send food back unless she felt it should return to the kitchen, and she didn't say anything. The filet came by itself, so I found myself hungry afterwards and ordered two cheese tastings which were nice as always. There just isn't anything special about Purple any longer........it's just get the customer in, and get them out...............I can feel a better energy and have a special dining experience elsewhere. Seattle has some great restaurants. Sorry Purple........won't be back. GC"

This place had some of the rudest, most pretentious @$$holes I have ever met. So we went in late on a Tuesday night after a Mariners game, as my buddies sister and friend were in town from the East Coast. After ordering a shot and a drink, we were content for about 45 minutes. My buddy ordered a drink and about 20 minutes later hadn't received it. When he finally received his drink, I ordered another, and jokingly asked him if I could get it in less than a half hour. Turns out we didn't look like the crowd they prefer, so he decided that my joke meant I was intoxicated and didn't deserve to be served anymore. It was my 2nd drink in an hour, AND we had ordered food. After speaking with a manager, he agreed that I did not look intoxicated, but they don't undermine the ""judgement of their staff"". Maybe my joke was in poor taste, but I was trying to be lighthearted, not offensive, and if you work in a bar, you should be ready to deal with garbage from rude patrons, and a little banter at the bar shouldn't be handled like that. 0 stars is what they deserve,, and I guarantee I will never return to this place.

By the time I was starting to eat the rest of the table was finished. Not even an acknowledgment from the waiter or an apology was given.

Enjoy a flight of wine and cheese pairing or something else before you order. I'm definitely not a wine buff and my wife is no expert, but we enjoy the ability to have a relaxing conversation and enjoy some new wines we normally wouldn't try. The staff is very helpful in recommending combinations and they don't make you feel out of place if you aren't a wine expert. The entrees have all been quite good and very reasonably priced, with the exception of the lobster mac' n cheese (although it is well worth the $27). My only complaint is how cold it sometimes feels. I would love to see a nice fireplace added to warm things up in the winter."

The wine markup isnt so bad, but that should be expected at a wine bar. They have a great wine list and good options for tastings of wine and cheeses by the flight. The bar doesnt know how to make a martini, but once again they are a wine bar. If anything, I would say they should simplify the food menu. I found it to be too many choices, found myself spending too much time reviewing the menu, but I went there for wine and appetizers, not for dinner, so I may be biased."

The atmosphere is calm and soothing and let's talk about their meals! They're well done and absolutely delicious! Dessert was a bit dry but I generally loved the whole experience. The décor is poetic from the choice of color and accessories in the establishment. The special service offered for a romantic date is just on another level. I think it would be had for any person to turn down an engagement  or wedding proposal that is made in this establishment. More to the service and the décor, the accommodation facilities befit loyalty. Spending a night at the establishment is an epic experience. I would definitely come back for a second date at this place and recommend it to my friends with a lot of confidence."

The ambiance is great -- dim lighting that worked seamlessly with the high ceilings & impressive floor-to-ceiling wine tower. The wait staff was extremely friendly, and made great food recommendations! We tried:- the Riesling -- sweet and fruity!- baked brie -- no need to elaborate, just get it.- seafood stew -- recommended by our waiter, and it was so good!

The service was friendly and the staff very attentive. We REALLY Really enjoyed our meal here. Probably one of the best corned beef hash I've had. The corned beef was tender, flavorful; potatoes perfectly fried; delicious rye bread and two fried eggs on top. My friend had the fried egg sandwich (provolone, bacon, egg, greens) which he thought was great. We had a vegan with us as well and the server said the chefs are really good at accommodating food requests. They made the Espanola vegan by replacing the eggs with more veggies and avocados. Everyone was satisfied. Great service as well. Facility was clean including the bathrooms. I can confidently recommend Purple Cafe to others!"

I wanted to take her somewhere nice and make it memorable for her. She's a wine and cheese lover so I knew she'd appreciate this place but I also wanted to take her here so she could try something new as she doesn't have a very adventurous palate.First off, the ambiance was nice and romantic. She loved the tower of wine and spiral staircase in the middle of the restaurant. We started off upstairs in the lounge with a drink while we waited for our table and then headed to our table where we chose from the Tasting Bar menu.She was feeling a little adventurous so we had the the Duck Liver Pate and the Ahi Tuna Poke which were both spectacular. For our entrees, the lady chose Duck Confit and I had Filet Mignon. She LOVED the Duck and couldn't stop raving about it.After the numerous bottles of wine and all the delicious food, I'd say we had a pretty sexy evening."

We all learned something, and chose a bottle, which was great. We dared not ask its cost though we had asked for ""value."" A few ""tasting"" rounds of apps, some salads, and some great entrees, I had the pork, done nicely, and the to die for deserts..... we picked up another bottle. The check arrived and our new favorite was only $30, very nice Purple, very nice.But what blows me away about this place is the size of the space.

Recently, I was here with two friends and we shared a cheese flight to start, then we each had an entree and dessert, plus we shared a great bottle of pinot noir. It worked out to $33 each, including tip. You can't beat that!Their sorbets are always creative, fresh and delicious, and I love their sea salt caramels (you can now get an order of sea salt caramels to go, by the way! They make a great hostess gift).I love the decor here, too. Service is a tad slow, but knowledgable and friendly. When my husband and I went to lunch here as a little celebration on the day we picked up our marriage certificate, they brought us out champagne and sea salt caramels--on the house!We go here five or six times a year, and every single experience has been great!"

The noodles were overcooked. The water was disgustingly lukewarm. None of the waiters knew who had what...I never recommend restaurants where waiters ask who had what. It's your job as a waiter to deliver the food from the kitchen to the proper person. That's the core task of being a waiter. Get it right. Four waiters came out with our food. It wasn't even timed properly. All four waiters asked 'who had what'.It was simply annoying.We were a party of eight and paid 18% gratuity for this poor service.

Ramen. From the reviews this place gets busy. Walked in a greeted warmly by the service staff. My server recommended Pork Gyoza (which I could get anywhere) but what the heck. It was pretty perfectly cooked, crisp and carmelized on one side and soft on the other. The dipping sauce was tangy with a bite of spice. Could be maybe the best Pork Gyoza I can remember having. Sooo good I ate all 5 pieces in about 3 minutes!!! That must be record time! No shame here...and I sipped on the dipping sauce. I am sure not the only one who does that?!?! For my ramen I had the Yuzu Shio. I will be honest with you I'm a Tongkatsu black garlic kind of a girl. But I think I have changed my way. The Yuzu Shio was simple, flavorful and hit the spot. Pork was so tender and perfectly balanced by the french sea salt. I would be all wrong it I didn't mention the soft boiled egg. You know you're giving 5 STARS when most of runny YOKE ends up on your upper lip as you slurp up the brothly goodness. Kizuki thanks for doing it right!!."

We each had a different ramen and came away so happily satisfied. I love Japanese food but have never really wanted to eat ramen. We were there in January 2016 and it was cold and snowing. Ramen sounded so good and so we drove over there. It's near my niece's college (Seattle University). Parking was a bit difficult but I found a little pay parking lot through the GPS and it was a few dollars and was in a safe area. Lots of students and office types at the restaurant. The food came out quickly. My daughter couldn't get over the delicious half cooked egg that came with her ramen. She had never tasted anything so delicious and she always talks about it. Not only was her egg delicious but the soup was wonderful too. We would highly recommend this place.

My friends' and my culinary journey encompassed an array of classic dishes, including Spaghetti bolognese, Mushroom & White Truffle Oil pasta, Carbonara with Campanelle, and Braised Beef Ragu. Unfortunately, the Carbonara with Campanelle failed to meet the lofty expectations, as it lacked the richness that I had anticipated. However, it was the Mushroom & White Truffle Oil pasta that stole the show, surpassing my expectations with its fragrance and flavor. While the unique sausage in the dish showcased the restaurant's creativity, it didn't align with my personal preferences. Lastly, the Braised Beef Ragu' emerged as a satisfactory choice but it wasn't mind-blowing Considering the price and the hype surrounding Due Cucina, my overall experience left me moderately enthusiastic in spite of the nice staff and the warm ambiance."

The ambiance is nice and romantic, the service is exceptional and the waiters/waitresses I've had are always very educated on the menu. Most importantly the pasta is amazing! Highly recommend!"

The casual atmosphere of the restaurant that serves great, healthy, inexpensive Italian food left us full and happy. My favourite dish from the restaurant was the pasta with oxtail ragu, and the spaghetti with tomato sauce. Having less carbs in their pasta also meant that I didn't leave the restaurant feeling bloated, I am still feeling full now after a few hours instead of feeling hungry again, which usually happens with normal pasta. There were 8 of us and we ordered a few dishes to share, the bill came up to just over $80."

I love this place! I had basil pesto and my friend had ox tail. My spaghetti was perfectly al-dente that you would usually have to pay $20 or more for this quality of pasta at other restaurants in Seattle BUT theirs was only about $10. I think their pasta is the best quality and best price in town.

Healthy pasta (made with 9 different grains as explained by the chef), a herb wall (hello urban farming), house-cured or artisanal meats and sauces made from scratch. The food itself is fresh and honest! The pastas have a rich, nutty flavour and a great texture and the sauces are bold, flavourful and tastes like.... real food! I ordered the basil pesto (the best I ever had) and my friends got the artisanal sausage with broccoli and Amatriciana. We couldn't pick a favourite. I never thought healthy food could taste so good! Oh don't forget to try their homemade sourdough too! It's the real deal!!I'm giving 5 stars for the food, vibe, price point, friendly staff and cleanliness!"

Rows of bottles on both sides of the wall. Outdoor patio dining as well. Great setting. The owner was friendly and helpful. Happy hour drinks and food every day. Food options were so much more than just bar food. Since there were only two of us, we will come back to try more of their menu. The fried chicken entrée came with three pieces and sides of creamy coleslaw and Mac salad. The chicken was so crunchy on the outside and tender, juicy inside. No wonder theirs won the best-fried chicken in WA in 2020. The dipping sauce that accompanied it added sweetness."

Stolen recipes, restaurant, and ownership. This restaurant was not brought up by these guys. I, was a loyal customer with the real owners. I wouldn't trust my credit card information under these crooks. They fail to follow health code procedures. Food isn't stored properly, even watching the video on their site: mojitoseattle.com/Mojito… you see the ""sous chef"" handled raw meat before touching ready to eat food that will be served to consumers.

Unfortunately our one try at dinner last year was awful.We started with mojitos. Blech. A couple pieces of mint, some sugar water, and crappy rum do not a good mojito make.I don't remember the exact dinner items we ordered but each of our meals came with three or four items. Between the total of six or seven foods, the only edible one between us was the tostones.To top off the bad food and drinks, this place was pricey, annoyingly loud, and offered horrendous service. While we were two of only six diners the staff seemingly forgot about us and we went without water refills or the chance to ask for sauces or anything else that might have improved the meal.Mojito was a terribly disappointing experience and it's doubtful we'll ever give this another try."

I like to support small local businesses, but I think you could benefit from a few improvements!Pros:-Owner is very nice and friendly-Vaca Frita had the best flavor and was well balanced-Colorful decorCons:-The dining area was cold and drafty -The music was a bit loud for lunch-The menus could use a wipe down (the cleaner everything in the dining room the cleaner the kitchen should be)We had the:-Mojito Platter: yucca frita, tostones, and maduros (needed more seasoning)I liked the maduros the best because they naturally have more flavor. -Vaca Frita: best dish for balanced flavors-Lechon Asado: bland and sides did not seem fresh or hot from the kitchen-Cuban Sandwich: great! would get againRecommendations to future diners: ask for the sauces on the side if you do not like raw garlic (it is super healthy for you, but has a strong taste)Mojito I will try you again!"

I've had this place bookmarked for months and at long last I was able to sit down and savor the flavor of the Caribbean! I was surprised how small it was! I mean, they have over 400 (mostly rave) reviews and maybe nine tables! That means that they have a steady stream of hip and satisfied customers. I had the roasted pollo (that's Spanish for ""chicken""). I have to say that while I found it very flavorful, it was a little dry. Good thing they had so many really tasty things to pair it with. The first bite of their black beans and a little carnival started inside my mouth. The flavor was so deep and complex! I also liked the rice. Nice and simple. And I can never find anything wrong with fried things. I was afraid of the yucca, but like I say, fry it and I'll like it! I especially enjoyed the fried plantains! The creamy sauce with which they top it is out of this world!One more word on the service: Great!"

The server was very nice, friendly, and funny. He gave us appetizers and added meat on our salad on the house because our colleague is returning to her home country. I am not writing a good review because of the food on the house; it made this special occasion even more special. And, the food was delicious! We had Mojito Platter, Arepa, Ensalad Palmito with steak, Veca Frita, Pescado Mojito, and Pescado en Guiso. The steak had wonderful citrus flavor. The meat in arepa was also very flavorful, and the ""bread"" part was so good. I particularly liked Pescado Mojito--white wine and cinnamon may sound unusual, but you just have to try it. The desserts (on the house, too!) weren't overly sweet, which was nice. Thank you, Server, for making our last lunch together unforgettable."

I had passed by it many times. But we were told we should try it and OH MY! We were greeted and seated right away. Our server was very nice and took the time to explain what some of the menu items were. We had a shredded beef that was so mouth watering delicous! we squeezed lime on it and it came with a rice adn black bean mixture adn plaintains that were simply incredible. 2 thumbs up on this one!

I don't know if it's authentic, all I knows and cares about is that it's slammin' good! I've had the Bistec A Caballo and the Vaca Frita so far and they do make a mean mojito. It is a small little weirdly shaped place, but that's part of it's charm in my opinion."
Xi'an Noodles,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/xian-noodles-seattle-9?not_recommended_start=0,Janice B.,1,12/18/2023,73,WA,I used to love this place but I was utterly disappointed by the food I received today. I returned to this place after a few years with high hopes but I couldn't even finish the food after a few bites. It was way too doughy and the sauce was tasteless. It's as if the ownership changed. It did not taste anything like I remembered.It's sad to see such a great restaurant has gone down but I will no longer return to this place.
Xi'an Noodles,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/xian-noodles-seattle-9?not_recommended_start=0,Matt M.,5,08/01/2018,30,WA,"Tried to go here order noodles, they are out of noodles. What? You have noodles in the name. Ordering machine is confusing. Only selection is no no noodles?"

After reading all the hype about it decided to try and didn't have a good experience. The cashier that took my order went to vegetable station to add my side order of mushrooms and used his bare hands to put it in the bowl and take it to the kitchen. I couldn't believe it. If they are so unsanitary in front of customers I can only imagine what's going on in that kitchen. My order was steamed chicken with noodles. Mushy noodles with bone in chicken not tasty. Won't be back!
Xi'an Noodles,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/xian-noodles-seattle-9?not_recommended_start=0,Hao T.,1,03/01/2019,3,OR,The floor is dirty and the entire place is like a mess. Food there is so so. One more thing is I got alimentary infection after I had the cold noodles there.
Xi'an Noodles,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/xian-noodles-seattle-9?not_recommended_start=0,Thiago A.,1,5/15/2018,1,WA,"People, please read the owner's responses. She is so rude to her customers. Instead of taking feedback and taking the proper response, she completely humiliates her own customers. This speaks volumes about how she runs her business. Buyer beware!Anyways, my review (I can't wait for her response): I'm from Brazil on vacation. After this experience, I had to create a Yelp account today. I decided to try various places yesterday. I'm a great fan of Chinese food. I was visiting a friend at UW and I decided to try this restaurant due to the Yelp reviews. Worst.Mistake.Ever. Do not eat here. The cashier is rude and the ""servers"" are even ruder. I agree with others: the food is too salty. When I ordered the Tingly Beef, it smelled...like smelled rotten. I think that's why they salt it so much - to hide the fact it's rotten. I had one bite and I spit it out. I think I know why they call it ""Tingly beef""...it makes your stomach tingly with pain. Terrible....so terrible!!! I truly don't understand how they have so many 5 star reviews. ""They must be fake"" - I put this in quotes because the owner always thinks any negative reviews are fake. Anyways, enjoy at your own risk!"

I don't understand why the government would let this restaurant open given such a bad design. awful service: everyone is busy and we have to order first. The waitress does not have the time to care about you.Please raise your bar on taste. If you have tried Xi'an authentic noodles, there is no way that this could be compared. I normally would not do Yelp BUT this restaurant is very disappointing. Please think before go!!"

Your noodles need improvement you need to face the problem not begging for good comment or warning the customers The owner said she would report my comment to Yelp no matter what u do. You and your restaurant suck

The spicy oil dumpling is sub-par. The filling is bland and the gravy/ soup is very salty. The spicy lamb cumin noodles is less than average. Shredded lamb makes their presence very insignificant and the meat has near to zero fragrance and taste. The noodles and sauce is of average and has zero spicy taste. Overall, a pretty disappointed meal."

The food is delicious, but it is very oily and spicy, and having tea would help wash it down and balance out the flavors more.Parking is not too bad since it's pretty up north from the campus. The service was okay."

We went here during a Seattle Washington rainstorm, my friend said it was a good spot. I like noodles and like to try different noodle joints when I am traveling so I went to Xi'an Noodles. Got the Pho vegetarian broth and they put the carrots, sprouts, cucumbers, jalapenos and cilantro on the side and also onions. The tastes of this Xi's different options for Asian foods, wow!!! love it, go here :). The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I was nervous walking to the restaurant, there were a few suspect characters hanging out outside"

There's an option to make your own noodle soup. Otherwise, you can choose from there Myriad of dishes. my favorite is the tingly beef and sauce as well as soup.

The food is phenomenal for lack of better terms. From the hand pulled noodles to the broth, the flavor and spice blend is just right. The texture of the noodles is firm and stays firm throughout the meal instead of loosing it's hold and disintegrating into the broth. The broth has a very bold flavor profile and yet not too oilly as you would expect with Chinese cooking. I've personally always gone for the noodles with soup but either choice never fails. Xi'an noodles are hard to explain, it's a perfect soup dish when you want noodles but you're not feeling pho or ramen."

I ordered a mocha and it was awesome, one of the better ones I've had in awhile. I also got a almond poppyseed muffin, the girl behind the counter told me she had just put them in the case, so they were fresh. I wasn't a fan of the muffin, it was really dense. That being said, I am still interested in trying some of the other pastries they have and trying other drinks. Weirdly, after I parked my car and started walking to the Cafe, I swear I saw my dads car....and then I realized MY DAD WORKS NEXT DOOR. I felt like a shitty daughter.

The Lemon Drop I ordered before my meal was made to perfection with fresh squeezed lemon; and I consider myself something of a Lemon Drop connoisseure :)  Most recently, I ordered the Gnocchi con Salsiccia e Funghi with portobello mushrooms added. The Gnocchi was perfectly cooked, which as some of you may know is difficult to do, and the dish was absolutely delightful, a masterpiece of complementary flavors and textures.The first time I came, the restaurant was close to empty and the atmosphere was relaxed and pleasant. The courses were spaced out and my friend and I had time to enjoy our conversation and take in the overall experience. The next time, my boyfriend and and I came for New Years Eve and although it was packed and hectic, the staff did an excellent job paying attention to the costumers and balancing the aesthetic of slow-paced European style dining with the fast-paced demands of the New Years crowd. And boy were some people demanding :) The table next to us seemed quite rushed and rude, even when they were brought a Tiramisu for the woman's birthday. Hey, I had to pay for mine! Not that I minded; I would have gladly pay double for that fluffy morsel. Alas, such is the nature of a busy restaurant. Overall, I could not be more pleased by the experiences this restaurant has afforded me and I will certainly be back very soon. Buono Appetito!"

First time had to wait about 40 minutes even though I had reservations for my anniversary dinner (made me feel a fool). This time was terrible for different reasons - many of them...First, got seated next to their huge booth, which somehow echoes and amplifies all the noise coming from it. Multiply that by wine-drunk women sitting there.Second, the food was no good. Got bread and the olive oil/vinegar dish. The bread we got was soo tiny that it was a joke. My date commented that they must have accidentally put a crouton instead. Asked for a larger bread and got it. I get that this is artisan-type bread. Their oil-vinegar presentation was terrible. They used some little deep dish that had vinegar on the bottom with a deep layer of oil on top. Problem is that there is no way to get both on the bread, so basically we were sopping up oil with the croutons.Their salumi plate was even bad - served on a gross cracked and discolored cutting board that should be tossed in the trash. Don't know why but the eats all seemed like they were dipped in oil.The ravioli fell apart. The two sides didn't stick together.Epic fail."

The service was okay, but not great. There was not wait as we went early on a week night.I hear that the menu changes a lot, and it must have been a good day for us as the food was great, but it was pretty expensive given the economic conditions.It's like Italian tapas, so we did as suggested by the server, and ordered six dishes for four people: Olives, panini, sea scallops, baked polenta, angolotti and spaghetti with wild boar bolognese. And wine. It cost $300.The portions are pretty sparse for the prices. I think $14 for four little scallops is exorbitant. They were good, but not worth the price. Ditto on the panini (it's a GRILLED SANDWICH) or the polenta, which were $9 and $13, respectively. I loved the spaghetti, though, and there was actually enough for all of us. For me, it's really a value thing. I'm still searching for that elusive Seattle restaurant that has top-notch food for reasonable prices."

The service & atmosphere didn't disappoint. They were still vibrantly busy at 9pm mid-week, and our server had great knowledge about the menu items & their preparation. Their service was warm & welcoming, and the bathrooms were spotless. The only reason I didn't give them 5/5 was because I was actually quite disappointed with the menu - it was tiny, consisting primarily of small plates & pasta. In addition, they were out of one of the pastas, so it was even more limited. The Bucatini pasta, while tasty, had so little sauce that it was barely discernible. All in all we will be back next time, but maybe just for late drinks & a small snack."

My favorites are the scallop crudo and the baby octopus, they had a perfect texture and a smokey flavor. As for a main course just go for the pasta, or whatever else sounds good on their menu because the menu is not very big; but everything on it has a big flavor. The only downside is that it can get very busy and when it gets busy it gets extremely loud, like you will have to shout at your boyfriend in his ear to be heard loud."

The place is tiny, but the atmosphere is still good. We sat at the bar and got great, friendly service all night. The menu was a little intimidating. Even though I consider myself pretty experienced in the kitchen, I didn't recognize half the things on there! They don't have a huge selection either, which was actually a breath of fresh air from the usual novels you see at chain restaurants. You know they must change their menu often and the things on there must be chef favorites. Their servers were really great about answering our questions and giving us suggestions, too.Like some other posters have said, the portions are small and the prices are a little high, but I think the experience outweighs that. I suggest getting some wine (recommendations from the bartender are always helpful), a couple appetizers and a couple entrees and just sharing everything. You might not leave stuffed, but I think you will leave satisfied. My favorite thing from the night was the honey potato gnocchi. Cooked perfectly with just the right amount of sweetness! I do not recommend the chocolate gelato, however. Maybe venture elsewhere for dessert :)"

My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary at this beautiful spot on Monday and I honestly am so bummed that I haven't been here sooner! As soon as we arrived through the front door we were greeted with an amazing energy from the staff. So many hellos and smiles to accompany the grace this restaurant has, was just the beginning of our experience. Our hostess was the epitome of perfect! Her eye contact and welcoming demeanor was such a breath of fresh air. She took the time to say congratulations for our celebration that evening, offered us a better suited table of we wanted, and explained everything to which we could understand. Thank You! As i sat across from the small intimate table from my husband, I observed every patron thoroughly enjoying their experience. Laughter could be heard, clinking of glasses echoed off the walls and the sunlight bouncing off the decor, was a picture perfect beginning to our night. Our waiter was fantastic! He really took his time with us! He explained the options we chose to start our night out with, and provided us with champagne that was pre ordered for our celebration. His authenticity and fabulous aura, was such a nice welcoming feeling. Now, the preparations of the menu items.... I swear, I have never tasted anything to heavenly in my entire life, minus my husband's home cooked meals (since he is the executive chef at Grappa and brother to the owner) every ounce of thought placed within the flavors were matched to Perfection! Every last bite I had was a mouthwatering as the first.. I couldn't get enough!!! I am so beyond thrilled to recommend this amazing gem to everyone and anyonen that is looking for a nice night out or just to be taken care of with grace and great attitudes! To those that worked this past Monday, I salute you to my and my husband's experience, making it one we will never forget. Till next time, Cheers!"

I adore the interior- I felt like I was in a ships hull all be it the nicest ship and the most modern hull. The wine list was LOVELY. I worked in wine in NY for a few years and although most of my knowledge has drifted out of my brain I certainly am snob enough to know a good Italian lineup. This is where my review gets boring. I loved all of it- from the wine to the food- the food was thoughtful and elegant. The staff was available, considerate of our needs and knowledgeable.  And they were playing PRINCE.  It might have been a little loud but it was still awesome. We danced in our seats. And we had a diverse crew- a wee 24 to a wise 55 and everything else between.

My party was placed on the waitlist, but after waiting for quite some time, we noticed that tables around us were being called and seated, yet we never heard our name.We approached the waitress, Wenjie, who was managing the waitlist. Wenjie insisted that she had called our table, but her voice was so quiet that no one in our party, nor those around us, could hear her. Instead of acknowledging this possibility or offering any sort of compromise, she doubled down and insisted she had done everything correctly. Her lack of flexibility and unwillingness to apologize made the situation even more frustrating.While the food may be good, the experience was overshadowed by this poor service. It's unfortunate that a lack of communication and unprofessional attitude from staff can ruin what could have been an enjoyable meal. I hope management addresses this issue to avoid upsetting more customers in the future."

There were two to three groups of people ahead of us yesterday at lunchtime, and we lined up for over 10 minutes without anyone greeting us. No one was there. I don't know how long the previous group waited, but we all left. My friends and I were HANGRY. We finally turned to upstairs DinTaiFung. DinTaiFung had two hosts serving us, and we got seated right away. Does Haidilao open the store for self-check-in? I don't know how the well-known service is, but it was a terrible experience for me.

Then the host brought us to the front again, and we had to step out to check our reservation. We are here for the noodle show, but the show is perfunctory. The sauce bar was dirty, and some ingredients were gone without refill. Not worth it to pay extra for a limited choice. The price is high and the flavor is just okay.

From the moment we walked in, we were welcomed with friendly smiles and seated right away. The atmosphere was modern, clean, and inviting, setting the perfect tone for a fun and interactive dining experience.We opted for a spicy Sichuan broth and a tomato broth, and both were absolutely delicious. The spicy broth had just the right amount of heat without being overwhelming, while the tomato broth was rich, flavorful, and slightly sweet--perfect for balancing out the spice.The ingredients were fresh and high-quality. We enjoyed a variety of thinly sliced meats, seafood, and vegetables, all of which cooked quickly and absorbed the flavors of the broth beautifully. My daughter especially loved the hand-pulled noodles, which were prepared tableside with an impressive and fun performance.Another highlight was the dipping sauce bar, where we got to mix our own sauces to complement the hotpot. There were plenty of ingredients to choose from, and we had fun experimenting with different combinations.The service was outstanding. The staff was incredibly attentive, refilling our broths, clearing plates, and making sure we had everything we needed. They even provided aprons to keep us clean and warm towels for added comfort.Haidilao Hotpot was a memorable experience for both of us, and we're already planning our next visit. If you're looking for a fun, flavorful, and interactive dining experience in Seattle, I can't recommend this place enough!"

The Angus beef for $1.99 and the Lamb shoulder for $2.99 were such good deals for the quality of meat you get. It's perfectly paired with their classic spicy broth.I always order the vegetable platter, mushrooms platter, and tofu platter to mix things up. And the fish roe lucky bag is a must-order for me every single time. The explosion of flavors inside that tofu bag filled with fish roe is delicious.The restaurant is very huge with some window seats that offer a view of Seattle downtown street. The highlight here is their sauce bar. With lots of options for appetizers, fruits, snacks, and desserts, there's something for everyone. And it's nice of them to provide instructions for each sauce style--it's a thoughtful touch.But I had some disappointing experiences. I have visited twice during non-busy hours, around 1-4pm, and the service can be a bit lacking. There were times when I couldn't find a server for 40 minutes, which was disappointing. However, my recent dinner visit was a different story--the service was prompt and attentive.Overall, Haidilao is a great spot for delicious hot pot. Based on my experience, I suggest going during dinner time for a better experience."

They showed me how to order and explained somethings. My waiter was very nice and made sure everything was okay. I came by myself so I just ordered the kobe beef belly combo. It was enough to satisfy me where I didn't feel gross, so personally for me the amount of food was good. I got 3 different soups my favorite was the pork bone broth (I think that's what it was called, the milky white color one). The traditional spicy was also good, pretty numbing. Lastly I ordered a mango green tea and that was also delicious. It tasted basically as the name suggests, mango with a hint of green tea flavor."

The food was delicious and beautifully presented. However, the service, particularly from the host during check-in, was not only rude and inattentive but also condescending and unfriendly. He seemed more interested in chatting with coworkers than acknowledging our presence, setting a negative tone for our visit. To make matters worse, my sister's experience mirrored mine. My sister joined our group later. When she asked the host for assistance in locating our table, his response was dismissive and unhelpful. Unfortunately, this unexpected behavior overshadowed the otherwise appealing food and ambiance, leading to a disappointing overall experience.Due to the unfavorable experience with the host, we were seriously considering seeking another dining establishment. Based on our overall experience, despite the good food, I would rate our visit to Kin Len Thai Night Bites as 1 out of 5. Moreover, considering the plethora of dining options available, it's unlikely that we will return to Kin Len Thai Night Bites in the future."

The customer service was by far the worst I have ever experienced. The receptionist consistently ignored us and even went so far as to call us liars, which is completely unacceptable.When we arrived, I didn't have my full party with me, so I asked if I could join the waitlist. The receptionist gave me an iPad to fill out our information, and the text message indicated that the wait time would be approximately 20 minutes. So when my friends arrived and waited for ~10 minutes, she decided to retrieve her jacket from the car. As soon as she left, a party of 6 walked in, and the receptionist immediately gave them a table. When I reminded him that we were still waiting, he first completely ignored me and walked away. Then when he returned, he rolled his eyes and accused us of lying about the number of people in our party, even though we clearly had four people.This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, and it is not the kind of service that customers should be subjected to. I am extremely disappointed in the way we were treated, and I hope that the restaurant takes steps to ensure that this kind of behavior does not happen again."

I understand it was busy but it was a Tuesday night and the place should've been staffed accordingly -Our food portions were extremely small compared to online pictures with a lot of stuff missing, this is not super bad but still disappointing. When we asked for refill on our soup for our 20$ hot pot they said they couldn't give any which was really interesting given the tiny portion size.- We asked for ice and never got it, I had to walk up to the bar to ask for it.- They spilled our food all over one of us and didn't apologize or offer anything to make it up to us. - They forced us to tip right in front of them due to their paying system: which is extremely rude because we felt as if we didn't want to tip but she was staring at us tip so we felt pressured. The server was a girl wearing low cut black v shirt with thick eyeliner & kinda chubby named Praew?(it said this name on the receipt) and this was one of the worst customer service experience I've ever experienced. Please do not come here for good food or good service. Go a few blocks down for better Thai food and actual servers."
Kin Len Thai Night Bites,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kin-len-thai-night-bites-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Lindsay M.,2,5/17/2024,286,NY,"I recently dined at Kin Len and, unfortunately, it was quite a disappointing experience. Firstly, we arrived excited for a relaxed evening, but the service left much to be desired. At the beginning, our server was extremely slow to take our order. We waited far too long to even get our drinks, which was frustrating. To make matters worse, when the end of our meal came around, it felt like the staff was rushing us out the door. The server brought the check without asking if we needed anything else, and hovered around, making us feel very unwelcome. She must've come to our table no less than 10 times in 10 minutes. Additionally, I was particularly disappointed to find that there were no vegetarian options on the happy hour menu. In this day and age, it's surprising that a restaurant wouldn't cater to a variety of dietary preferences, especially during a popular time like happy hour.Overall, the combination of poor service and lack of menu options really soured what should have been an enjoyable evening. I hope they make some changes to improve the dining experience."
Kin Len Thai Night Bites,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/kin-len-thai-night-bites-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Sharon T.,3,3/26/2023,55,CA,"My recent visit to Kin Lin was a mixed experience. While I enjoyed some of the dishes, others left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. The standout dish was the glass noodle in clay pot - it was very flavorful and the shrimp was cooked to perfection. The dish had a nice blend of spices that made it a pleasure to eat.However, the fried chicken with red curry was a bit of a letdown. Although the chicken was cooked well, I found the red curry to be too sweet for my taste. It lacked the spicy kick that I usually associate with Thai cuisine, and as a result, it didn't live up to my expectations.On the service front, everything was fine. The staff were courteous and attentive, and the food was served promptly. Overall, my experience at Kin Lin was average. While there were some highlights, there were also some letdowns. If you're in the area and looking for a Thai meal, it's worth considering, but don't expect anything too extraordinary"

We tried the papaya salad, larb, and red curry with chicken, and all the dishes were top-notch. The flavors were vibrant and authentic, with the perfect balance of spices that made each bite a treat. The red curry, in particular, was rich and creamy, with tender chicken that soaked up all the flavors beautifully while still remaining quite crispy. The interior of the restaurant is stylish and fun, making it a great place to hang out, especially during happy hour. The deals are great, and the vibe really adds to the overall experience. Happy hour is definitely a must if you're visiting!The only downside is that there can be a bit of a wait, and they require the whole party to be present before seating, which can be a little inconvenient if you're with a group. However, the wait is worth it once you're inside.Overall, Kin Len Thai Night Bites is definitely worth a visit for the food and atmosphere. Just be prepared to wait if you're coming during peak hours. We'll definitely be back!"

They were able to make some.of the dishes vegan which was great! Everything was very good but wouldn they the corn salad again. It really didn't have any flavor other than corn (which I LOVE corn) but for some reason it just didn't do it for any of us. Would highly recommend checking this place out.

I've been here in several occasions and there can be long waits but the food is 100% worth it. Our go to order is the crispy battered red curry chicken and the Phad See Eiw with chicken.

I wanted to finally try this place on my birthday. I'd been dying to visit but things just never lined up for whatever reason, but it was worth the wait! First, the vibe is super fun; modern mixed in with traditional and hip hop playing from the speakers! Off to a great start!Our server is fabulous - friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable. We ordered the battered chicken red curry, shrimp cakes & crispy pork belly & Chinese broccoli. The shrimp cakes were tasty but the entrees were stupid-good. I could eat the curry every single day and not get sick of it. The flavors and textures were perfect. I did find myself wishing there was more curry, but just wow! 12/10The pork belly was crispy and tender - flavorful! and the broccoli was perfectly prepared. 10/10There wasn't a bad bite on that table and I'm dying to get back in and work my way through their menu!!"

The people who work here/run this place are fantastic. The beer list is on point, and the cocktail I had was delicious. Thanks SRB! We will make this a regular stop when in Seattle. On a side note, after reading a few of the reviews on here, I have a quick comment:@ Ken M. - For real? You gave a bar 3 stars because of Monday Night Football? If you show up to a bar, and it's ""not what you were looking for"", you leave and don't write a review. There are bars in either direction that don't have TVs. It's just bad form to say the drinks and service were awesome and then leave a 3-star rating."

The food was delicious but what really impressed me was the service. Our server Brian was just the right amount of attentive.  He made great suggestions when asked, kept our drinks topped off, and was super considerate -- even asking us how we wanted our bill split rather than just bringing it out. He even wrote in the tip box on each person's receipt that 18% gratuity had already been included. I felt compelled to add additional tip anyways!To top it off, I accidentally left my credit card there. I returned later in the day and they checked my ID and returned the card. I'll definitely be back!"

Great local beer selection and they are always adding fresh ones. They don't have a million tap handles and I like that, makes you try something new. On that note they do cover the beer spectrum with the selection, so something for everyone. Staff rocks, the waitress totally gave me permission to be as creepy and awesome as I wanted. Couple TVs, some tunes, and tasty food. Haven't had the wings but if they are half as amazing as the guacamole then bring extra socks because your feet will get cold when they are blown straight off.

The bartender running the place was extremely kind in letting us order a cocktail and a tallboy each on the happy hour price (half price off all booze basically!) We also split a plate of sweet potato fries which were adequate. When it came for the bill, they split the fries onto all of our bills so we all paid the same. It was a really cool little detail that I appreciated a lot. It's a very thoughtful spot, great for conversations with your friends. Could do without the flatscreen tvs, but I get it. Will return!"

We experienced poor service during both visits to Pink Salt. Food was good but not great. Drinks were excellent. Maybe it just takes time for the owners to get into the swing of things - but we likely won't go back for dining - maybe a glass of wine but that's about it. Disappointing.  I agree with one of the other reviewers - if you're going to charge as much as you do, you really have to deliver."

There are not a lot of restaurant options in Magnolia that are worth going our of your way for, but Pink Salt is the exception. The food was delicious. Highly recommend getting the Yuca Rellana to start. The Pesto Rissotto with Tenderloin was also delicious. I only had a glass of wine but they had some tasty looking cocktails on the menu that are probably worth a try. The food was on the pricier side but it was cooked to perfection. We made reservations but were surprised that the restaurant was largely unoccupied on a Saturday night. It was nice that the restaurant was quiet but it was hard to get a sense for what the ambiance was intended to be. Great choice for delicious food and a nice dinner out though!"

Even with the crowd, the employees still patiently explain the menus to us and help us place an to-go order. They quoted the wait to be 30 mins, so we decide to go for a walk. After about 20 mins, they called and tell is the food is ready for pickup, which I appreciate the additional effort. The food is still warm when we got home, it's sealed properly, no spills and everything is accurate. We ordered the Mala Udon with the non-spicy broth and it's delicious! The soup is exceptional.

It's got that perfect mix of chill and stylish that makes it great for any occasion.Now, let's talk about the food. Almanqal absolutely nails it. Every dish we tried was packed with flavor, and you can tell they use fresh, high-quality ingredients. The grilled meats were perfectly cooked, and the Schwarma platter? So good. The hummus was some of the creamiest and tastiest I've had--definitely worth the trip alone. My favorite thing on the menu is the Lamb Kabob, which comes with your choice of appetizer. ( I recommend the baba ghanoush)The service was top-notch, too. The staff were attentive but not over the top, always checking in without making us feel rushed. They were also super helpful when we had questions about the menu.Overall, Almanqal is the kind of place where you feel like you're getting a truly special experience.

In a nutshell, this place is extraordinary. After trying lamb, beef, and chicken dishes all around town, I can confidently say that Almanqal is in a league of its own. The flavors are simply incredible, and the meats are exceptionally tender. If you're a fan of lamb, beef, or chicken, you absolutely must pay them a visit.Their lentil soup is a warm hug in a bowl, and the Lamb Shank is a culinary masterpiece that practically melts in your mouth.Almanqal is now my go-to spot for forever.

We were excited to go to this place as it had been on our list to try for over a year. We were so disappointed since we only find ourselves in Seattle 1-2x a year! I'm upset that no one ever called me to say the restaurant was closing early that day, very unprofessional. We sat outside the restaurant scrambling to find another restaurant to go to."

While the food was decent, the service was far from acceptable. The sushi chef, who had visible tattoos, gave us incredibly rude service. His bad attitude and unkind words completely ruined what should have been a fun dinner. It's a shame because the quality of the food couldn't make up for the unpleasant interaction. I won't be returning."
Sugo Hand Roll Bar,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/sugo-hand-roll-bar-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Emma N.,1,11/17/2022,1,WA,"Before I go in on why I am giving one star, I do want to say the food is great! A little overpriced. So I wouldn't go here with a complete empty stomach. My favorite was the spicy tuna and Hawaiian poke. I also liked the Lychee martini they had. The miso soup was amazingly paired with the tempura shrimp as well.The reason why I'm giving a terrible review is because the service was so bad. I read some reviews on here about the service and it's BAD! I read a review here that their manager yells at their employees while trying to be nice to the customers. I also saw reviews on here that the hostess flirts with the sushi chef? Completely unprofessional. Well anyways, my server was this girl with the weird neck tattoos. I forgot her name. She seemed so annoyed serving us and just seemed straight up rude. We would constantly have to ask for refills on the water and she seemed annoyed that we were ordering more rolls. It's like do you want us to eat here or not? She seems like she doesn't want to be there and that we were an inconvenience. And hearing the workers talk about their personal life so loud from the back is annoying. Who wants to hear about their drama when you're trying to have a nice meal?Overall, this place is alright. Food is amazing but it comes with terrible service. Management needs fixing because why are you as an adult yelling at your employees like they're 5? Talk to them and manage them like they're adults and maybe they'll listen. Definitely need new servers too who want to be there and who is there to work, not to play gossip girl. Sad to say I love the food but hate the people."

The entrance was oddly decorated and staff were scattered, leaving their belongings on chairs in the dining area. Our table was located in a separate room, which was an unusual setup. The sushi was alright, but nothing stood out as particularly special, and with the high prices, I was left feeling underwhelmed and still hungry. While the restaurant itself was visually appealing and the staff seemed kind, they also came across as shy. With the underwhelming food and high price tag, I don't think I'll be coming back to Sugo Sushi."
Sugo Hand Roll Bar,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/sugo-hand-roll-bar-seattle-2?not_recommended_start=0,Dan Y.,2,2/20/2023,2,NJ,"Disappointed by my visit. Sugo checks all the boxes for a hand roll restaurant- bar seating, a quick-paced dining experience, and somewhat pricey, bite-sized offerings- but doesn't execute well.I ordered the set of 5 hand rolls for $33. This includes chef's selections of scallop, spicy tuna, snow crab, and eel, and lobster ( a substitute for salmon which they were out of).I was expecting to pay a premium for food that prioritized quality of ingredients over quality. Maybe Sugo does use fresh ingredients, but it was impossible to tell as much of the sashimi was served grounded up and mixed with Japanese mayo to the point where it was difficult to differentiate one roll from the next. This confusion wasn't helped by the lack of explanation of what was being served. It was towards the end of service so perhaps our chef was more interested in wrapping up our meal. The experience felt rushed and frenetic on the whole. More on the service- the restaurant automatically charges a 19% and boasts a minimum $23/hr wage. I'm all for this on principle, but the quality of our service was subpar. The staff came across as confused and somewhat unaccommodating. For example, when we were told they were out of salmon, we were told that the only possible substitution would be lobster without reasonable explanation as to why we couldn't substitute something of equal or lesser value. In another instance, another staff member came by to offer to refill my full glass of water while ignoring my friend with an empty glass. Just odd things here and there that dampened the overall visit.  I was visiting from out of town, but I'm confident you can find sushi of equal quality for far better value elsewhere."

The service was...strange. We had waitlist inconsistencies which is understandable. But in the meantime the seating waitress yelled an expletive, for which she did apologize. The strange part came after at the actual hand roll bar, where we were told as part of the set we ordered there wasn't King Salmon, oh wait there was King Salmon, and of course there wasn't King Salmon. She said we had to replace it with lobster, which we asked if we could pick a different roll (of lesser value) and the waitress declined without any real reasoning (along the lines of ""it's our choice when we replace it"" and ""for the value"", honestly didn't understand). Water refilling was awkward too. It was just strange. Then on to the food:- spicy tuna: very spicy, oddly very spicy - scallop: was spicy without any indication of it being so on the menu- snow crab: very mayo- lobster: very very mayo - eel: probably the best, nothing to write home about They all lacked an appropriate amount of rice to balance the flavors, so I was left with very salty, overly flavored taste and no real raw fish... which, echoing the service, strange for a ""sushi"" experienceHonestly probably wouldn't recommend given the price and the other sushi available in the area. But glad I tried!"

We're usually pretty laid-back, but we couldn't help noticing how off the mark the servers were, a sharp contrast to the sushi chef's warmth. Little things like not emailing receipts or grumbling about being swamped left a sour taste. We get that restaurant life is tough, but basic courtesy should be a given, right?"

This place truly never disappoints. This is my favorite place to come and dine and bond with my sister and mom. The GM Sharon makes the experience such a warm and fun one every time! The sushi bar is unlike any experience I have had in Seattle. We were served by Chef Johnny and Tito and they were nothing short of super attentive. We always get the 5 handroll set and do al la carte for the rest of the menu. I highly recommend the wagyu uni and ikura and the uni caviar!! The freshness of the fish is unbeatable in Seattle. They also have tamari (gluten free soy sauce), which I greatly appreciate the thought behind it because I have a gluten allergy. We have been coming here for over a year at least once a month because the service, ambiance, and food is just unbeatable. During our most recent visit we had Joseph as our server and he was amazing! Super kind, and humorous, also made great suggestions. I always look forward to our once a month family gatherings at Sugo and appreciate everything they do!"

I've been on a temaki lookout in Seattle. I got my own choices with the different hand rols. Favorites were thepoke,scallop, lobster and the crab. The crab temaki was amazing and wow!

I've been to probably 10 different Poke spots throughout Seattle and this is literally second to none. I took my family here as I was showing them Seattle and Pike Place for the first time and it was their favourite food throughout the entire weekend they visited. Cocktails here are also top tier. Service, food, drinks - everything was phenomenal. This is one of those hidden gems since it opened up not long ago so get a piece of it while it's not too busy!"

The sushi Roles are first class. I'm a big sushi eater and have been to a lot of local places and this one was special.The Spicy Tuna was my favorite although I enjoyed all the food. My wife loved her Special Saki drink. It was there soft open but here was still a bunch of interesting stuff on the menu.I didn't get a chance to try the appetizers but they looked really good.I suggest trying a bunch of different items because we really enjoyed the unique flavors. Interesting with just the right balance of flavor.It was nice to have friendly and professional service. We felt we where appreciated. It was overall a very good night.

I moved here from Los Angeles a few years ago where I ate sushi on a regular basis. I have been to many of the best LA sushi restaurants (Nobu, Takami, Sugarfish, etc). Great to find a new local place where I can get great sushi roles. I suggest the spicy tuna. It was super fresh with a perfect level of spice for me. Everything we had was overall good. No complaints.Not as expensive as LA. That was a relief. Looking forward to trying some of their unusual appetizers.The service was above average."

The ambiance is fun and unique. The staff were friendly. The food menu is small but high quality. The hand-rolled sushi is die for. We also tried the clam miso soup and the Norichos. Both were incredibly tasty. Th drink menu is so unique and creative. You have to try the lychee martini. The prices were very reasonable. We had such a great experience overall. We will definitely be back again"

The waitress was very polite and totally sincere about us enjoying the food.I thought the price was very reasonable for such good food. I think I found my new go to place.

QUALITY- I haven't enjoyed fish in such as way until I started eating here! AMBIENCE- talk about authenticity!! I went to Japan before the pandemic and this resembles a lot of what I saw there. SERVICE- this restaurant is not only memorable for the food, but the people. Staff was so kind and made me feel super welcomed.

I loveeee sushi and did not know what to expect just stumbling across this place while showing a out of town friend what Pike Place has to offer. So happy we found it! It was just their second day of a soft opening so they didn't have their full menu yet but what they had was AMAZING. I'm honestly considering going back tonight, that good. A lot of the basics you see but also some really unique items (truffle avocado roll? Yes please. Wagyu with uni and caviar? Sign me up). My sushi server was not just making us delicious rolls but entertaining us with great conversation throughout the meal. Apparently there is a second side of the restaurant that will open for summer time, can't wait to see what they do there! If I could give 6 stars I would - So good!"

I tried the 4 set along with a crispy shrimp roll and wagyu roll. Overall the quality of the fish/food was top notch. Found the clam miso a touch salty; the wagyu roll with uni/caviar was amazing! Will definitely be back soon."

Tried Sugo for their soft opening and their food is already some of the best I've had in Seattle. The waiters and waitresses are really committed to providing great service and are really friendly.

Windy City Pie,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/windy-city-pie-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Karyl H.,1,11/09/2021,4,WA,The service and the pizza were the absolute worst. Never eating here again.
Windy City Pie,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/windy-city-pie-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,Patrick N.,1,8/21/2021,23,WA,"Was so excited to try Windy City and I'm extremely disappointed. We took our ""Carnivore"" home and it was so wet that I was able to fold the slice in half, vertically. The dough was like a wet sponge and it really appeared that the pizza was parbaked earlier in the day or even the day before. There was no marrying of the cheese and the sauce, and fully intact low-cost Hormel-esque pepperoni, further lending to evidence of pre-baking. Zero crunch, zero crisp. The dough was also way too sweet. This is not Chicago Style Pizza. So truly disappointed and I won't be going back. UPDATE: The owners of this establishment cannot handle any criticism of their sub-par pizza and resort to sophomoric replies that wave like a flag of unprofessional defensiveness. Their response of keeping our pizza flat, which we did, would have nothing to do with the pizza being wet, underbaked, and pre-made. Please don't waste your money here, there are far better pizza places and other local businesses that are actually deserving of your business."

Windy City Pie,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/windy-city-pie-seattle?not_recommended_start=0,John P.,2,02/05/2024,1,CA,"1st, for reference, see the photo of the menu presented when ordering online - There is no clear indication between Chicago Deep Dish (not labeled) and thin cracker crust other than a tiny banner over some that says ""Tavern-Style"", and a stand-alone pizza called ""Tavern Style Thin Pizza"" with red sauce and mozzarella. We can't be the only ones to have made this mistake, and hopefully WCP figures out how to handle it better and fix their on-line system...We ordered what we thought were 2 Chicago-style deep dish pizzas online with dine in for two people and had to prepay everything including the tip. We get there early, they confirm our reservation and sit us, and the wait person confirms our order for 2 thin cracker crust pizzas. We let them know that we were expecting deep dish but their response was to first show us the menu and our mistake, and that we could order and pay for a 3rd deep dish pizza. 3 pizzas for 2 people :/ and we were already in for $80.  We expressed our frustration very clearly, even including the words, ""It's fine"", which anyone in customer service should know means, ""This customer is really dissatisfied and frustrated"" and we need to make it better, including getting management involved. The thin crust pizzas came and at some point we were asked how was everything, to which we laid out our frustration very clearly. The waitstaff could only defend themselves and didn't offer any resolution, only excuses. They did offer to get the manager but at that point we had enough. We never saw that waitperson again or a manager, but someone did show up and made me pay for my $8 beer before we left."

And this review is overdue, but still SO necessary to share. When we were planning our wedding, we knew we wanted great food, and didn't want to use typical catering. We thought of Windy City Pie and contacted Dave who helped us make it a reality. Serving 100 guests, we offered three pies (omnivore, Brussels snout, and 4 pepper) along with the beets by Schrute salad, on each table for a sit-down dinner. Dave and his team went above and beyond to provide us with amazing looking pizzas that tasted delicious. From planning to delivery and dinner, everything was amazing."

Windy City Pie,https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/windy-city-pie-seattle?not_recommended_start=20,Ron L.,5,08/12/2019,2,IL,"I was on a trip from Chicago and I wanted to try a pizza like Pequod's Pizza so my wife and I went to Windy City Pie. WOW! It was better than Chicago's Pequod's Pizza. Pizza has been a big part of my life. I've tried every type of pizza in Chicago over the years and there is always room for more great pizza. This is a new great one.We order online. That made getting our pizza easy when we got to Phinney. Cool space. Love the eclectic environment. Neat bar and drinks. Check out the artwork. But it's the food and the friendly staff that make this place great. It is the food that is the star of this evening. We had the Meatza. The crust was crisp especially the carmelized cheese edge. It may look burnt to those who don't understand what they are getting but don't overlook that delicious part of the pizza. The sauce is a perfectly tangy and sweet combination. The homemade sausage was delicious. The bacon and pepperoni are equally balanced with the other ingredients. The cheese works as a great counterpoint to the sauce and the other in tasty fresh parts of this masterpiece. This pizza is an indulgence that is worth the calories and carbs. Go for it. If you're worried about your diet they have other great options. My wife had the All Kale Caesar! salad. She loved the freshness, the switch of kale for the romaine lettuce and taste overall with a smaller serving of pizza which left more for me. This place is busy, order online, but be patient. They have games you can play while you wait or just watch the campy movie on the screen. Enjoy your night at this unique place."

A pizza missionary, if I may.Out of the people I have shared a pie with, I have a 100% conversion rate, spanning over dozens of friends and coworkers who in turn shared this glorious, cheesy wonder with the people they know.Keep up the awesome work, Windy City Pie."

What makes this pizza different is mostly how delicious it is, but the pizza maker working his ass off with the kind of quality you can't find elsewhere... That's what tasting the fruits of a person's American dream is like. Don't believe me? Try this stuff, LIFECHANGING. Keep kicking ass Dave, you're amazing!"
